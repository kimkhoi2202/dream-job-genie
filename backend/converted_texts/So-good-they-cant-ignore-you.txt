Introduction
The Passion of the Monk
“ ‘Follow your passion’ is
dangerous advice.”
Thomas had this realization in
one of the last places you might
expect. He was walking a trail
through the oak forest that outlines
the southern bowl of Tremper
Mountain. The trail was one of
many that cross through the 230-
acre property of the Zen Mountain
Monastery, which has called this
corner of the Catskill Mountains its
home since the early 1980s. Thomas
was halfway through a two-year
stay at the monastery, where he was
a practicing lay monk. His arrival,
one year earlier, had been the
fulfillment of a dream-job fantasy
that he had nurtured for years. He
had followed his passion for all
things Zen into this secluded
Catskills retreat and had expected
happiness in return. As he stood in
the oak forest that afternoon,
however, he began to cry, his
fantasy crumbling around him.
“I was always asking, ‘What’s
the meaning of life?’ ” Thomas told
me when I first met him, at a coffee
shop in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
By then, several years had passed
since Thomas’s realization in the
Catskills, but the path that led him
to that point remained clear and he
was eager to talk about it, as if the
recounting would help exorcise the
demons of his complicated past.
After earning a pair of bachelor’s
degrees in philosophy and theology,
then a master’s degree in
comparative religion, Thomas
decided that Zen Buddhist practice
was the key to a meaningful life.
“There was such a big crossover
between the philosophy I was
studying and Buddhism that I
thought, ‘Let me just go practice
Buddhism directly to answer these
big questions,’ ” he told me.
After graduation, however,
Thomas needed money, so he took
on a variety of jobs. He spent a
year, for example, teaching English
in Gumi, an industrial town in
central South Korea. To many, life
in East Asia might sound romantic,
but this exoticism soon wore off for
Thomas. “Every Friday night, after
work, the men would gather at
these street carts, which had tents
extending out from them,” Thomas
told me. “They gathered to drink
soju [a distilled rice liquor] late into
the night. During winter there
would be steam coming from these
tents, from all the men drinking.
What I remember most, however, is
that the next morning the streets
would be covered in dry vomit.”
Thomas’s search also inspired
him to travel across China and into
Tibet, and to spend time in South
Africa, among other journeys,
before ending up in London
working a rather dull job in data
entry. Throughout this period,
Thomas nurtured his conviction
that Buddhism held the key to his
happiness. Over time, this
daydream evolved into the idea of
him living as a monk. “I had built
up such an incredible fantasy about
Zen practice and living in a Zen
monastery,” he explained to me. “It
came to represent my dream come
true.” All other work paled in
comparison to this fantasy. He was
dedicated to following his passion.
It was while in London that
Thomas first learned about the Zen
Mountain Monastery, and he was
immediately attracted to its
seriousness. “These people were
practicing really intense and sincere
Zen,” he recalls. His passion
insisted that the Zen Mountain
Monastery was where he belonged.
It took nine months for Thomas
to complete the application process.
When he finally arrived at Kennedy
airport, having been approved to
come live and practice at the
monastery, he boarded a bus to take
him into the Catskill countryside.
The ride took three hours. After
leaving the city sprawl, the bus
proceeded through a series of
quaint towns, with the scenery
getting “progressively more
beautiful.” In a scene of almost
contrived symbolism, the bus
eventually reached the foot of
Tremper Mountain, where it
stopped and let Thomas out at a
crossroads. He walked from the bus
stop down the road leading to the
monastery entrance, which was
guarded by a pair of wrought-iron
gates, left open for new arrivals.
Once on the grounds, Thomas
approached the main building, a
four-story converted church
constructed from local bluestone
and timbered with local oak. “It is
as if the mountain offered itself as a
dwelling place for spiritual
practice” is how the monks of the
monastery describe it in their
official literature. Pushing past the
oaken double doors, Thomas was
greeted by a monk who had been
tasked with welcoming newcomers.
Struggling to describe the emotions
of this experience, Thomas finally
managed to explain it to me as
follows: “It was like being really
hungry, and you know that you’re
going to get this amazing meal—
that is what this represented for
me.”
Thomas’s new life as a monk
started well enough. He lived in a
small cabin, set back in the woods
from the main building. Early in his
visit he asked a senior monk, who
had been living in a similar cabin
for over fifteen years, if he ever got
tired of walking the trail connecting
the residences to the main building.
“I’m only just starting to learn it,”
the monk replied mindfully.
The days at the Zen Mountain
Monastery started as early as 4:30
A.M., depending on the time of
year. Remaining in silence, the
monks would greet the morning
with forty to eighty minutes of
meditation on mats arranged with
“geometric precision” in the main
hall. The view outside the Gothic
windows at the front of the hall was
spectacular, but the mats kept the
meditators too low to see out. A
pair of hall monitors sat at the back
of the room, occasionally pacing
among the mats. Thomas explained:
“If you found yourself falling
asleep, you could request that they
hit you with a stick they kept for
this purpose.”
After breakfast, eaten in the same
great hall, everyone was assigned
jobs. Thomas spent time cleaning
toilets and shoveling ditches as part
of his housecleaning duties, but he
was also assigned, somewhat
anachronistically, to handle the
graphic design for the monastery’s
print journal. A typical day
continued with more meditation,
interviews with senior practitioners,
and often long, inscrutable Dharma
lectures. The monks were given a
break each evening before dinner.
Thomas often took advantage of
this respite to light the woodstove
in his cabin, preparing for the cold
Catskill nights.
Thomas’s problems began with
the koans. A koan, in the Zen
tradition, is a word puzzle, often
presented as a story or a question.
They’re meant to defy logical
answers and therefore force you to
access a more intuitive
understanding of reality. In
explaining the concept to me,
Thomas gave the following
example, which he had encountered
early in his practice: “Show me an
immovable tree in a heavy wind.”
“I don’t even know what an
answer to that would look like,” I
protested.
“In an interview,” he explained,
“you have to answer right away, no
thinking. If you pause like that, they
kick you out of the room; the
interview is over.”
“Okay, I would have been
kicked out.”
“Here’s the answer I gave to pass
the koan,” he said. “I stood, like a
tree, and waved my hands slightly
as if in a wind. Right? The point
was that this is a concept you really
couldn’t capture in words.”
One of the first major hurdles a
young practitioner faces in serious
Zen practice is the Mu koan:
Passing this koan is the first of the
“eight gates” of Zen Buddhism.
Until you reach this milestone,
you’re not yet considered a serious
student of the practice. Thomas
seemed reluctant to explain this
koan to me. I had encountered this
before in my research on Zen:
Because these puzzles defy
rationality, any attempt to describe
them to a non-practitioner can be
trivializing. Because of this I didn’t
press Thomas for details. Instead, I
Googled it. Here’s one translation I
found:
A pilgrim of the way asked the
Grand Master Zhaozhou,
“Does a dog have Buddha
nature or not?” Zhaozhou
said, “Mu.”
In Chinese, mu translates
roughly to “no.” According to the
interpretations I found, Zhaozhou is
not answering the pilgrim’s
question, but is instead pushing it
back to the questioner. Thomas
struggled to pass this koan,
focusing on it intensely for months.
“I worked and worked on that
koan,” he told me. “I went to bed
with it; I let it inhabit my whole
body.”
Then he cracked it.
“One day I was walking in the
forest, and a moment passed. I had
been looking at these leaves, and ‘I’
had disappeared. We all experience
things like this but don’t attach any
importance to them. But when I had
this experience, I was prepared for
it, and it clicked. I realized, ‘This is
the whole koan.’ ” Thomas had
achieved a glimpse of the unity of
nature that forms the core of the
Buddhist understanding of the
world. It was this unity that
provided the answer to the koan.
Excited, at his next interview with a
senior monk Thomas made a
gesture—“a simple gesture,
something you might do in
everyday life”—that made it clear
that he had an intuitive
understanding of the koan’s
answer. He had made it through the
first gate: He was officially a serious
student of Zen.
It was not long after passing the
Mu koan that Thomas had his
realization about passion. He was
walking in the same woods where
he had cracked the koan. Armed
with the insight provided by
passing the Mu, he had begun to
understand the once obtuse lectures
given most days by the senior
monks. “As I walked that trail, I
realized that these lectures were all
talking about the same thing as the
Mu koan,” said Thomas. In other
words, this was it. This was what
life as a Zen monk offered:
increasingly sophisticated musings
on this one, core insight.
He had reached the zenith of his
passion—he could now properly
call himself a Zen practitioner—and
yet, he was not experiencing the
undiluted peace and happiness that
had populated his daydreams.
“The reality was, nothing had
changed. I was exactly the same
person, with the same worries and
anxieties. It was late on a Sunday
afternoon when I came to this
realization, and I just started
crying.”
Thomas had followed his
passion to the Zen Mountain
Monastery, believing, as many do,
that the key to happiness is
identifying your true calling and
then chasing after it with all the
courage you can muster. But as
Thomas experienced that late
Sunday afternoon in the oak forest,
this belief is frighteningly naïve.
Fulfilling his dream to become a
full-time Zen practitioner did not
magically make his life wonderful.
As Thomas discovered, the path
to happiness—at least as it concerns
what you do for a living—is more
complicated than simply answering
the classic question “What should I
do with my life?”
A Quest Begins
By the summer of 2010, I had
become obsessed with answering a
simple question: Why do some
people end up loving what they do,
while so many others fail at this
goal? It was this obsession that led
me to people like Thomas, whose
stories helped cement an insight I
had long suspected to be true:
When it comes to creating work
you love, following your passion is
not particularly useful advice.
The explanation for what started
me down this path goes something
like this: During the summer of
2010, when this preoccupation first
picked up steam, I was a
postdoctoral associate at MIT,
where I had earned my PhD in
computer science the year before. I
was on track to become a professor,
which, at a graduate program like
MIT’s, is considered to be the only
respectable path. If done right, a
professorship is a job for life. In
other words, in 2010 I was planning
what might well be my first and last
job hunt. If there was ever a time to
figure out what generates a passion
for one’s livelihood, this was it.
Tugging more insistently at my
attention during this period was the
very real possibility that I wouldn’t
end up with a professorship at all.
Not long after meeting Thomas, I
had set up a meeting with my
advisor to discuss my academic job
search. “How bad of a school are
you willing to go to?” was his
opening question. The academic job
market is always brutal, but in 2010,
with an economy still in recession,
it was especially tough.
To complicate matters, my
research specialty hadn’t proven to
be all that popular in recent years.
The last two students to graduate
from the group where I wrote my
dissertation both ended up with
professorships in Asia, while the
last two postdocs to pass through
the group ended up in Lugano,
Switzerland, and Winnipeg,
Canada, respectively. “I have to say,
I found the whole process to be
pretty hard, stressful, and
depressing,” one of these former
students told me. Given that my
wife and I wanted to stay in the
United States, and preferably on the
East Coast, a choice that drastically
narrowed our options, I had to face
the very real possibility that my
academic job search would be a
bust, forcing me to essentially start
from scratch in figuring out what to
do with my life.
This was the backdrop against
which I launched what I eventually
began to refer to as “my quest.” My
question was clear: How do people
end up loving what they do? And I
needed an answer.
This book documents what I
discovered in my search.
Here’s what you can expect in the
pages ahead:
As mentioned, I didn’t get far in
my quest before I realized, as
Thomas did before me, that the
conventional wisdom on career
success—follow your passion—is
seriously flawed. It not only fails to
describe how most people actually
end up with compelling careers, but
for many people it can actually
make things worse: leading to
chronic job shifting and unrelenting
angst when, as it did for Thomas,
one’s reality inevitably falls short of
the dream.
With this as a starting point, I
begin with Rule #1, in which I tear
down the supremacy of this passion
hypothesis. But I don’t stop there.
My quest pushed me beyond
identifying what doesn’t work,
insisting that I also answer the
following: If “follow your
passion” is bad advice, what
should I do instead? My search for
this answer, described in Rules
#2–4, brought me to unexpected
places. To better understand the
importance of autonomy, for
example, I ended up spending a day
at an organic farm owned by a
young Ivy League graduate. To
better nuance my understanding of
skill, I spent time with professional
musicians—examples of a dying
craftsman culture that I thought had
something important to say about
how we approach work. I also
dived into the world of venture
capitalists, screenwriters, rock-star
computer programmers, and of
course, hotshot professors, to name
just a few more examples among
many—all in an effort to pick apart
what matters and what doesn’t
when building a compelling career.
I was surprised by how many
sources of insight became visible
once I burned off the obscuring fog
generated by a mono-focused
insistence on following your
passion.
The narratives in this book are
bound by a common thread: the
importance of ability. The things
that make a great job great, I
discovered, are rare and valuable. If
you want them in your working
life, you need something rare and
valuable to offer in return. In other
words, you need to be good at
something before you can expect a
good job.
Of course, mastery by itself is
not enough to guarantee happiness:
The many examples of well-
respected but miserable
workaholics support this claim.
Accordingly, this main thread of my
argument moves beyond the mere
acquisition of useful skills and into
the subtle art of investing the career
capital this generates into the right
types of traits in your working life.
This argument flips conventional
wisdom. It relegates passion to the
sidelines, claiming that this feeling
is an epiphenomenon of a working
life well lived. Don’t follow your
passion; rather, let it follow you in
your quest to become, in the words
of my favorite Steve Martin quote,
“so good that they can’t ignore
you.”
To many, this concept is a
radical shift, and as with any
disruptive idea, it needs to make a
splashy entrance. This is why I
wrote this book in a manifesto
style. I divided the content into four
“rules,” each given a deliberately
provocative title. I also tried to
make the book short and punchy: I
want to introduce a new way of
looking at the world, but I don’t
want to belabor the insights with
excessive examples and
discussions. This book does offer
concrete advice, but you won’t find
ten-step systems or self-assessment
quizzes in these pages. This topic is
too subtle to be reduced to the
formulaic.
By the end of this book, you’ll
have learned how my own story
ends up and the specific ways I’m
applying the insights in my own
working life. We’ll also return to
Thomas, who after his dispiriting
realization at the monastery was
able to return to his first principles,
move his focus away from finding
the right work and toward working
right, and eventually build, for the
first time in his life, a love for what
he does. This is the happiness that
you, too, should demand.
It’s my hope that the insights that
follow will free you from simplistic
catchphrases like “follow your
passion” and “do what you love”—
the type of catchphrases that have
helped spawn the career confusion
that afflicts so many today—and
instead, provide you with a realistic
path toward a meaningful and
engaging working life.
 RULE #1
Don’t Follow Your Passion
Chapter One
The “Passion” of Steve Jobs
In which I question the validity of
the passion hypothesis, which says
that the key to occupational
happiness is to match your job to a
pre-existing passion.
The Passion Hypothesis
In June 2005, Steve Jobs took the
podium at Stanford Stadium to give
the commencement speech to
Stanford’s graduating class.
Wearing jeans and sandals under
his formal robe, Jobs addressed a
crowd of 23,000 with a short
speech that drew lessons from his
life. About a third of the way into
the address, Jobs offered the
following advice:
You’ve got to find what you
love…. [T]he only way to do
great work is to love what you
do. If you haven’t found it
yet, keep looking, and don’t
settle.
When he finished, he received a
standing ovation.
Though Jobs’s address contained
several different lessons, his
emphasis on doing what you love
was the clear standout. In the
official press release describing the
event, for example, Stanford’s news
service reported that Jobs “urged
graduates to pursue their dreams.”
Soon after, an unofficial video
of the address was posted on
YouTube, where it went viral,
gathering over 3.5 million views.
When Stanford posted an official
video, it gathered an additional 3
million views. The comments on
these clips homed in on the
importance of loving your work,
with viewers summarizing their
reactions in similar ways:
“The most valuable lesson is to
find your purpose, follow your
passions…. Life is too short to be
doing what you think you have to
do.”
“Follow your passions—life is
for the living.”
“Passion is the engine to living
your life.”
“[It’s] passion for your work that
counts.”
“ ‘Don’t Settle.’ Amen.”
In other words, many of the
millions of people who viewed this
speech were excited to see Steve
Jobs—a guru of iconoclastic
thinking—put his stamp of
approval on an immensely
appealing piece of popular career
advice, which I call the passion
hypothesis:
The Passion Hypothesis
The key to occupational
happiness is to first figure out
what you’re passionate about
and then find a job that
matches this passion.
This hypothesis is one of
modern American society’s most
well-worn themes. Those of us
lucky enough to have some choice
in what we do with our lives are
bombarded with this message,
starting at an early age. We are told
to lionize those with the courage to
follow their passion, and pity the
conformist drones who cling to the
safe path.
If you doubt the ubiquity of this
message, spend a few minutes
browsing the career-advice shelf the
next time you visit a bookstore.
Once you look past the technical
manuals on résumé writing and job-
interview etiquette, it’s hard to find
a book that doesn’t promote the
passion hypothesis. These books
have titles like Career Match:
Connecting Who You Are with
What You’ll Love to Do, and Do
What You Are: Discover the Perfect
Career for You Through the
Secrets of Personality Type, and
they promise that you’re just a few
personality tests away from finding
your dream job. Recently, a new,
more aggressive strain of the
passion hypothesis has been
spreading—a strain that despairs
that traditional “cubicle jobs,” by
their very nature, are bad, and that
passion requires that you strike out
on your own. This is where you
find titles like Escape from Cubicle
Nation, which, as one review
described it, “teaches the tricks
behind finding what makes you
purr.”
These books, as well as the
thousands of full-time bloggers,
professional counselors, and self-
proclaimed gurus who orbit these
same core issues of workplace
happiness, all peddle the same
lesson: to be happy, you must
follow your passion. As one
prominent career counselor told
me, “do what you love, and the
money will follow” has become the
de facto motto of the career-advice
field.
There is, however, a problem
lurking here: When you look past
the feel-good slogans and go deeper
into the details of how passionate
people like Steve Jobs really got
started, or ask scientists about what
actually predicts workplace
happiness, the issue becomes much
more complicated. You begin to
find threads of nuance that, once
pulled, unravel the tight certainty of
the passion hypothesis, eventually
leading to an unsettling recognition:
“Follow your passion” might just
be terrible advice.
It was around the time I was
transitioning from graduate school
that I started to pull on these
threads, eventually leading to my
complete rejection of the passion
hypothesis and kicking off my
quest to find out what really matters
for creating work you love. Rule #1
is dedicated to laying out my
argument against passion, as this
insight—that “follow your passion”
is bad advice—provides the
foundation for everything that
follows. Perhaps the best place to
start is where we began, with the
real story of Steve Jobs and the
founding of Apple Computer.
Do What Steve Jobs Did, Not What
He Said
If you had met a young Steve Jobs
in the years leading up to his
founding of Apple Computer, you
wouldn’t have pegged him as
someone who was passionate about
starting a technology company.
Jobs had attended Reed College, a
prestigious liberal arts enclave in
Oregon, where he grew his hair
long and took to walking barefoot.
Unlike other technology visionaries
of his era, Jobs wasn’t particularly
interested in either business or
electronics as a student. He instead
studied Western history and dance,
and dabbled in Eastern mysticism.
Jobs dropped out of college after
his first year, but remained on
campus for a while, sleeping on
floors and scrounging free meals at
the local Hare Krishna temple. His
non-conformity made him a
campus celebrity—a “freak” in the
terminology of the times. As Jeffrey
S. Young notes in his exhaustively
researched 1988 biography, Steve
Jobs: The Journey Is the Reward,
Jobs eventually grew tired of being
a pauper and, during the early
1970s, returned home to California,
where he moved back in with his
parents and talked himself into a
night-shift job at Atari. (The
company had caught his attention
with an ad in the San Jose Mercury
News that read, “Have fun and make
money.”) During this period, Jobs
split his time between Atari and the
All-One Farm, a country commune
located north of San Francisco. At
one point, he left his job at Atari for
several months to make a
mendicants’ spiritual journey
through India, and on returning
home he began to train seriously at
the nearby Los Altos Zen Center.
In 1974, after Jobs’s return from
India, a local engineer and
entrepreneur named Alex Kamradt
started a computer time-sharing
company dubbed Call-in Computer.
Kamradt approached Steve
Wozniak to design a terminal device
he could sell to clients to use for
accessing his central computer.
Unlike Jobs, Wozniak was a true
electronics whiz who was obsessed
with technology and had studied it
formally at college. On the flip side,
however, Wozniak couldn’t
stomach business, so he allowed
Jobs, a longtime friend, to handle
the details of the arrangement. All
was going well until the fall of
1975, when Jobs left for the season
to spend time at the All-One
commune. Unfortunately, he failed
to tell Kamradt he was leaving.
When he returned, he had been
replaced.
I tell this story because these are
hardly the actions of someone
passionate about technology and
entrepreneurship, yet this was less
than a year before Jobs started
Apple Computer. In other words, in
the months leading up to the start of
his visionary company, Steve Jobs
was something of a conflicted
young man, seeking spiritual
enlightenment and dabbling in
electronics only when it promised
to earn him quick cash.
It was with this mindset that later
that same year, Jobs stumbled into
his big break. He noticed that the
local “wireheads” were excited by
the introduction of model-kit
computers that enthusiasts could
assemble at home. (He wasn’t alone
in noticing the potential of this
excitement. When an ambitious
young Harvard student saw the first
kit computer grace the cover of
Popular Electronics magazine, he
formed a company to develop a
version of the BASIC programming
language for the new machine,
eventually dropping out of school
to grow the business. He called the
new firm Microsoft.)
Jobs pitched Wozniak the idea of
designing one of these kit computer
circuit boards so they could sell
them to local hobbyists. The initial
plan was to make the boards for
$25 apiece and sell them for $50.
Jobs wanted to sell one hundred,
total, which, after removing the
costs of printing the boards, and a
$1,500 fee for the initial board
design, would leave them with a
nice $1,000 profit. Neither Wozniak
nor Jobs left their regular jobs: This
was strictly a low-risk venture
meant for their free time.
From this point, however, the
story quickly veers into legend.
Steve arrived barefoot at the Byte
Shop, Paul Terrell’s pioneering
Mountain View computer store, and
offered Terrell the circuit boards
for sale. Terrell didn’t want to sell
plain boards, but said he would buy
fully assembled computers. He
would pay $500 for each, and
wanted fifty as soon as they could
be delivered. Jobs jumped at the
opportunity to make an even larger
amount of money and began
scrounging together start-up capital.
It was in this unexpected windfall
that Apple Computer was born. As
Young emphasizes, “Their plans
were circumspect and small-time.
They weren’t dreaming of taking
over the world.”
The Messy Lessons of Jobs
I shared the details of Steve Jobs’s
story, because when it comes to
finding fulfilling work, the details
matter. If a young Steve Jobs had
taken his own advice and decided
to only pursue work he loved, we
would probably find him today as
one of the Los Altos Zen Center’s
most popular teachers. But he
didn’t follow this simple advice.
Apple Computer was decidedly not
born out of passion, but instead
was the result of a lucky break—a
“small-time” scheme that
unexpectedly took off.
I don’t doubt that Jobs
eventually grew passionate about
his work: If you’ve watched one of
his famous keynote addresses,
you’ve seen a man who obviously
loved what he did. But so what? All
that tells us is that it’s good to enjoy
what you do. This advice, though
true, borders on the tautological and
doesn’t help us with the pressing
question that we actually care
about: How do we find work that
we’ll eventually love? Like Jobs,
should we resist settling into one
rigid career and instead try lots of
small schemes, waiting for one to
take off? Does it matter what
general field we explore? How do
we know when to stick with a
project or when to move on? In
other words, Jobs’s story generates
more questions than it answers.
Perhaps the only thing it does make
clear is that, at least for Jobs,
“follow your passion” was not
particularly useful advice.
Chapter Two
Passion Is Rare
In which I argue that the more you
seek examples of the passion
hypothesis, the more you recognize
its rarity.
The Roadtrip Nation Revelation
It turns out that Jobs’s complicated
path to fulfilling work is common
among interesting people with
interesting careers. In 2001, a group
of four friends, all recently
graduated from college, set out on a
cross-country road trip to interview
people who “[lived] lives centered
around what was meaningful to
them.” The friends sought advice
for shaping their own careers into
something fulfilling. They filmed a
documentary about their trip, which
was then expanded into a series on
PBS. They eventually launched a
nonprofit called Roadtrip Nation,
with the goal of helping other
young people replicate their
journey. What makes Roadtrip
Nation relevant is that it maintains
an extensive video library of the
interviews conducted for the
project1. There’s perhaps no better
single resource for diving into the
reality of how people end up with
compelling careers.
When you spend time with this
archive, which is available for free
online, you soon notice that the
messy nature of Steve Jobs’s path is
more the rule than the exception. In
an interview with the public radio
host Ira Glass, for example, a group
of three undergraduates press him
for wisdom on how to “figure out
what you want” and “know what
you’ll be good at.”
“In the movies there’s this idea
that you should just go for your
dream,” Glass tells them. “But I
don’t believe that. Things happen in
stages.”
Glass emphasizes that it takes
time to get good at anything,
recounting the many years it took
him to master radio to the point
where he had interesting options.
“The key thing is to force yourself
through the work, force the skills to
come; that’s the hardest phase,” he
says.
Noticing the stricken faces of his
interviewers, who were perhaps
hoping to hear something more
uplifting than work is hard, so suck
it up, Glass continues: “I feel like
your problem is that you’re trying
to judge all things in the abstract
before you do them. That’s your
tragic mistake.”2
Other interviews in the archive
promote this same idea that it’s hard
to predict in advance what you’ll
eventually grow to love. The
astrobiologist Andrew Steele, for
example, exclaims, “No, I had no
idea what I was going to do. I
object to systems that say you
should decide now what you’re
going to do.” One of the students
asks Steele if he had started his PhD
program “hoping you’d one day
change the world.”
“No,” Steele responds, “I just
wanted options.”3
Al Merrick, the founder of
Channel Island Surfboards, tells a
similar tale of stumbling into
passion over time. “People are in a
rush to start their lives, and it’s
sad,” he tells his interviewers. “I
didn’t go out with the idea of
making a big empire,” he explains.
“I set goals for myself at being the
best I could be at what[ever] I
did.”4
In another clip, William Morris,
a renowned glass blower based in
Stanwood, Washington, brings a
group of students to his workshop
set in a converted barn surrounded
by lush, Pacific Northwest forest. “I
have a ton of different interests, and
I don’t have focus,” one of the
students complains. Morris looks at
her: “You’ll never be sure. You
don’t want to be sure.”5
These interviews emphasize an
important point: Compelling
careers often have complex
origins that reject the simple idea
that all you have to do is follow
your passion.
This observation may come as a
surprise for those of us who have
long basked in the glow of the
passion hypothesis. It wouldn’t,
however, surprise the many
scientists who have studied
questions of workplace satisfaction
using rigorous peer-reviewed
research. They’ve been discovering
similar conclusions for decades, but
to date, not many people in the
career-advice field have paid them
serious attention. It’s to these
overlooked research efforts that I
turn your attention next.
The Science of Passion
Why do some people enjoy their
work while so many other people
don’t? Here’s the CliffsNotes
summary of the social science
research in this area: There are
many complex reasons for
workplace satisfaction, but the
reductive notion of matching your
job to a pre-existing passion is not
among them.
To give you a better sense of the
realities uncovered by this research,
here are three of the more
interesting conclusions I’ve
encountered:
Conclusion #1: Career Passions
Are Rare
In 2002, a research team led by the
Canadian psychologist Robert J.
Vallerand administered an extensive
questionnaire to a group of 539
Canadian university students6. The
questionnaire’s prompts were
designed to answer two important
questions: Do these students have
passions? And if so, what are they?
At the core of the passion
hypothesis is the assumption that
we all have pre-existing passions
waiting to be discovered. This
experiment puts that assumption to
the test. Here’s what it found: 84
percent of the students surveyed
were identified as having a passion.
This sounds like good news for
supporters of the passion
hypothesis—that is, until you dive
deeper into the details of these
pursuits. Here are the top five
identified passions: dance, hockey
(these were Canadian students,
mind you), skiing, reading, and
swimming. Though dear to the
hearts of the students, these
passions don’t have much to offer
when it comes to choosing a job. In
fact, less than 4 percent of the total
identified passions had any relation
to work or education, with the
remaining 96 percent describing
hobby-style interests such as sports
and art.
Take a moment to absorb this
result, as it deals a strong blow to
the passion hypothesis. How can we
follow our passions if we don’t
have any relevant passions to
follow? At least for these Canadian
college students, the vast majority
will need a different strategy for
choosing their career.
Conclusion #2: Passion Takes
Time
Amy Wrzesniewski, a professor of
organizational behavior at Yale
University, has made a career
studying how people think about
their work. Her breakthrough
paper, published in the Journal of
Research in Personality while she
was still a graduate student,
explores the distinction between a
job, a career, and a calling7. A job,
in Wrzesniewski’s formulation, is a
way to pay the bills, a career is a
path toward increasingly better
work, and a calling is work that’s
an important part of your life and a
vital part of your identity.
Wrzesniewski surveyed
employees from a variety of
occupations, from doctors to
computer programmers to clerical
workers, and found that most
people strongly identify their work
with one of these three categories.
A possible explanation for these
different classifications is that some
occupations are better than others.
The passion hypothesis, for
example, predicts that occupations
that match common passions, such
as being a doctor or a teacher,
should have a high proportion of
people who experience the work as
a true calling, while less flashy
occupations—the type that no one
daydreams about—should have
almost no one experiencing the
work as a calling. To test this
explanation, Wrzesniewski looked
at a group of employees who all
had the same position and nearly
identical work responsibilities:
college administrative assistants.
She found, to her admitted surprise,
that these employees were roughly
evenly split between seeing their
position as a job, a career, or a
calling. In other words, it seems
that the type of work alone does not
necessarily predict how much
people enjoy it.
Supporters of the passion
hypothesis, however, might reply
that a position like a college
administrative assistant will attract a
wide variety of employees. Some
might arrive at the position because
they have a passion for higher
education and will therefore love
the work, while others might
stumble into the job for other
reasons, perhaps because it’s stable
and has good benefits, and
therefore will have a less exalted
experience.
But Wrzesniewski wasn’t done.
She surveyed the assistants to figure
out why they saw their work so
differently, and discovered that the
strongest predictor of an assistant
seeing her work as a calling was the
number of years spent on the job.
In other words, the more
experience an assistant had, the
more likely she was to love her
work.
This result deals another blow to
the passion hypothesis. In
Wrzesniewski’s research, the
happiest, most passionate
employees are not those who
followed their passion into a
position, but instead those who
have been around long enough to
become good at what they do. On
reflection, this makes sense. If you
have many years’ experience, then
you’ve had time to get better at
what you do and develop a feeling
of efficacy. It also gives you time to
develop strong relationships with
your coworkers and to see many
examples of your work benefiting
others. What’s important here,
however, is that this explanation,
though reasonable, contradicts the
passion hypothesis, which instead
emphasizes the immediate
happiness that comes from
matching your job to a true passion.
Conclusion #3: Passion Is a Side
Effect of Mastery
Not long into his popular TED talk,
titled “On the Surprising Science of
Motivation,” author Daniel Pink,
discussing his book Drive, tells the
audience that he spent the last
couple of years studying the science
of human motivation. “I’m telling
you, it’s not even close,” he says.
“If you look at the science, there is
a mismatch between what science
knows and what business does.”
When Pink talks about “what
science knows,” he’s referring, for
the most part, to a forty-year-old
theoretical framework known as
Self-Determination Theory (SDT),
which is arguably the best
understanding science currently has
for why some pursuits get our
engines running while others leave
us cold.8
SDT tells us that motivation, in
the workplace or elsewhere,
requires that you fulfill three basic
psychological needs—factors
described as the “nutriments”
required to feel intrinsically
motivated for your work:
Autonomy: the feeling that you
have control over your day,
and that your actions are
important
Competence: the feeling that
you are good at what you do
Relatedness: the feeling of
connection to other people
The last need is the least
surprising: If you feel close to
people at work, you’re going to
enjoy work more. It’s the first two
needs that prove more interesting.
It’s clear, for example, that
autonomy and competence are
related. In most jobs, as you
become better at what you do, not
only do you get the sense of
accomplishment that comes from
being good, but you’re typically
also rewarded with more control
over your responsibilities. These
results help explain Amy
Wrzesniewski’s findings: Perhaps
one reason that more experienced
assistants enjoyed their work was
because it takes time to build the
competence and autonomy that
generates this enjoyment.
Of equal interest is what this list
of basic psychological needs does
not include. Notice, scientists did
not find “matching work to pre-
existing passions” as being
important for motivation. The traits
they did find, by contrast, are more
general and are agnostic to the
specific type of work in question.
Competence and autonomy, for
example, are achievable by most
people in a wide variety of jobs—
assuming they’re willing to put in
the hard work required for mastery.
This message is not as inspiring as
“follow your passion and you’ll
immediately be happy,” but it
certainly has a ring of truth. In
other words, working right trumps
finding the right work.
Chapter Three
Passion Is Dangerous
In which I argue that subscribing
to the passion hypothesis can make
you less happy.
The Birth of the Passion Hypothesis
It’s difficult to pinpoint the exact
moment when our society began
emphasizing the importance of
following your passion, but a good
approximation is the 1970
publication of What Color Is Your
Parachute? The author, Richard
Bolles, was working at the time for
the Episcopal Church advising
campus ministers, many of whom
were in danger of losing their jobs.
He published the first edition of
Parachute as a straightforward
collection of tips for those facing
career change. The original print
run was one hundred copies.
The premise of Bolles’s guide
sounds self-evident to the modern
ear: “[Figure] out what you like to
do… and then find a place that
needs people like you.” But in 1970,
this was a radical notion. “[At the
time,] the idea of doing a lot of
pen-and-paper exercises in order to
take control of your own career was
regarded as a dilettante’s exercise,”
Bolles recalls1. The optimism of
this message, however, caught on:
You can control what you do with
your life, so why not pursue what
you love? There are now more than
six million copies of Bolles’s book
in print.
The decades since the
publication of Bolles’s book can be
understood as a period of
increasing dedication to the passion
hypothesis. You can visualize this
shift by using Google’s Ngram
Viewer2. This tool allows you to
search Google’s vast corpus of
digitized books to see how often
selected phrases turn up in
published writing over time. If you
enter “follow your passion,” you
see a spike in usage right at 1970
(the year when Bolles’s book was
published), followed by a relatively
steady high usage until 1990, at
which point the graph curve swings
upward. By 2000, the phrase
“follow your passion” was showing
up in print three times more often
than in the seventies and eighties.
Parachute, in other words,
helped introduce the baby boom
generation to this passion-centric
take on career, a lesson they have
now passed down to their children,
the echo boom generation, which
has since raised the bar on passion
obsession. This young generation
has “high expectations for work,”
explains psychologist Jeffrey
Arnett, an expert on the mindset of
the modern postgrad. “They expect
work to be not just a job but an
adventure[,]… a venue for self-
development and self-expression[,]
… and something that provides a
satisfying fit with their assessment
of their talents.”3
Even if you accept my argument
that the passion hypothesis is
flawed, it’s at this point that you
might respond, “Who cares!” If the
passion hypothesis can encourage
even a small number of people to
leave a bad job or to experiment
with their career, you might argue,
then it has provided a service. The
fact that this occupational fairy tale
has spread so far should not cause
concern.
I disagree. The more I studied
the issue, the more I noticed that the
passion hypothesis convinces
people that somewhere there’s a
magic “right” job waiting for them,
and that if they find it, they’ll
immediately recognize that this is
the work they were meant to do.
The problem, of course, is when
they fail to find this certainty, bad
things follow, such as chronic job-
hopping and crippling self-doubt.
We can see this effect in the
statistics. As I just established, the
last several decades are marked by
an increasing commitment to
Bolles’s contagious idea. And yet,
for all of this increased focus on
following our passion and holding
out for work we love, we aren’t
getting any happier. The 2010
Conference Board survey of U.S.
job satisfaction found that only 45
percent of Americans describe
themselves as satisfied with their
jobs. This number has been steadily
decreasing from the mark of 61
percent recorded in 1987, the first
year of the survey. As Lynn Franco,
the director of the Board’s
Consumer Research Center notes,
this is not just about a bad business
cycle: “Through both economic
boom and bust during the past two
decades, our job satisfaction
numbers have shown a consistent
downward trend.” Among young
people, the group perhaps most
concerned with the role of work in
their lives, 64 percent now say that
they’re actively unhappy in their
jobs. This is the highest level of
dissatisfaction ever measured for
any age group over the full two-
decade history of the survey4. In
other words, our generation-
spanning experiment with passion-
centric career planning can be
deemed a failure: The more we
focused on loving what we do, the
less we ended up loving it.
These statistics, of course, are
not clear-cut, as other factors play a
role in declining workplace
happiness. To develop a more
visceral understanding of this
unease, we can turn to anecdotal
sources. Consider Alexandra
Robbins and Abby Wilner’s 2001
ode to youth disaffection,
Quarterlife Crisis: The Unique
Challenges of Life in Your
Twenties. This book chronicles the
personal testimony of dozens of
unhappy twentysomethings who
feel adrift in the world of work.
Take, for example, the tale of Scott,
a twenty-seven-year-old from
Washington, D.C.
“My professional situation now
couldn’t be more perfect,” Scott
reports. “I chose to pursue the
career I knew in my heart I was
passionate about: politics…. I love
my office, my friends… even my
boss.” The glamorous promises of
the passion hypothesis, however,
led Scott to question whether his
perfect job was perfect enough.
“It’s not fulfilling,” he worries
when reflecting on the fact that his
job, like all jobs, includes difficult
responsibilities. He has since
restarted his search for his life’s
work. “I’ve committed myself to
exploring other options that interest
me,” Scott says. “But I’m having a
hard time actually thinking of a
career that sounds appealing.”
“I graduated college wanting
nothing more than the ultimate job
for me,” says Jill, another young
person profiled in Quarterlife
Crisis. Not surprisingly, everything
Jill tried failed to meet this high
mark.
“I’m so lost about what I want to
do,” despairs twenty-five-year-old
Elaine, “that I don’t even realize
what I’m sacrificing.”5
And so on. These stories, which
are increasingly common at all ages,
from college students to the middle-
aged, all point toward the same
conclusion: The passion
hypothesis is not just wrong, it’s
also dangerous. Telling someone
to “follow their passion” is not just
an act of innocent optimism, but
potentially the foundation for a
career riddled with confusion and
angst.
Beyond Passion
Before continuing, I should
emphasize an obvious point: For
some people, following their
passion works. The Roadtrip
Nation archives, for example,
include an interview with Rolling
Stone film critic Peter Travers, who
claims that even as a child he used
to bring notebooks into movie
theaters to record his thoughts6.
The power of passion is even more
common when you look to the
careers of gifted individuals, such
as professional athletes. You’d be
hard-pressed, for example, to find a
professional baseball player who
doesn’t claim that he has been
passionate about the sport as far
back as he can remember.
Some people I’ve talked to about
my ideas have used examples of
this type to dismiss my conclusions
about passion. “Here’s a case where
someone successfully followed
their passion,” they say, “therefore
‘follow your passion’ must be good
advice.” This is faulty logic.
Observing a few instances of a
strategy working does not make it
universally effective. It is necessary
instead to study a large number of
examples and ask what worked in
the vast majority of the cases. And
when you study a large group of
people who are passionate about
what they do, as I did in
researching this book, you find that
most—not all—will tell a story
more complex than simply
identifying a pre-existing passion
and then pursuing it. Examples such
as Peter Travers and professional
athletes, therefore, are exceptions.
If anything, their rareness
underscores my claim that for most
people, “follow your passion” is
bad advice.
This conclusion inspires an
important follow-up question:
Without the passion hypothesis to
guide us, what should we do
instead? This is the question I take
up in the three rules that follow.
These rules chronicle my quest to
figure out how people really end
up loving what they do. They
represent a shift away from the tone
of lawyerly argument used here and
into something more personal:
evidence of my attempts to capture
the complexity and ambiguity of my
encounters with the reality of
workplace happiness. With the
thorny underbrush of the passion
hypothesis cleared, we can only
now bring light to a more realistic
strain of career advice that has so
long been strangled in the shadows.
This is a process that begins in the
next rule with my arrival at an
unlikely source of insight: a group
of bluegrass musicians practicing
their craft in the suburbs of Boston.
 RULE #2
Be So Good They Can’t Ignore
You
(Or, the Importance of Skill)
Chapter Four
The Clarity of the Craftsman
In which I introduce two different
approaches to thinking about
work: the craftsman mindset, a
focus on what value you’re
producing in your job, and the
passion mindset, a focus on what
value your job offers you. Most
people adopt the passion mindset,
but in this chapter I argue that the
craftsman mindset is the
foundation for creating work you
love.
Upstairs at the Bluegrass Frat House
When I first rounded the corner
onto Mapleton Street, the house, a
careworn Victorian, blended in with
its tidy suburban neighbors. It was
only as I got closer that I noticed
the eccentricities. The paint was
peeling. There was a pair of leather
recliners outside on the porch.
Empty Bud Light bottles littered the
ground.
Jordan Tice, a professional guitar
player of the New Acoustic style,
stood by the front door smoking a
cigarette. He waved me over. As I
followed him inside, I noticed that a
small foyer set off the entry had
been converted into a bedroom.
“The banjo player who sleeps there
has a PhD from MIT,” Jordan said.
“You’d like him.”
Jordan is one of many musicians
who come and go from the rental,
squeezing themselves into any
space that meets the technical
definition of habitable. “Welcome
to the bluegrass frat house,” he
said, by way of explanation as we
headed up to the second floor
where he lives. Jordan’s room is
monastic. Smaller than any dorm
room I had at college, it’s just big
enough for a twin bed and a simple
pressboard desk. A Fender tube
amp sits in one corner and a rolling
luggage bag in the other. Most of
his guitars, I assume, are kept
downstairs in the common practice
space, as I only saw one in the
room, a beat-up Martin. We had to
borrow a chair from another room
so that we could both sit.
Jordan is twenty-four. In the
world of traditional work this is
young, but when you consider that
he signed his first record deal while
still in high school, it’s clear that in
the world of acoustic music
Jordan’s no rookie. He’s also
painfully modest. One review of his
third album, Long Story, began,
“Music has always had its share of
prodigies, from Mozart up to the
current day.”1 This is exactly the
type of praise that Jordan would
hate for me to write about. When I
asked him why Gary Ferguson, a
well-known bluegrass artist, chose
Jordan at the age of sixteen to tour
with him, he could only stammer,
before lapsing into silence.
“It’s a big deal,” I pushed. “He
chose you to be his guitar player.
He had his choice of lots of guitar
players, and he chose a sixteen-
year-old.”
“I don’t derive any arrogance
from that specific thing,” he finally
answered.
Here’s what does excite Jordan:
his music. When I asked him,
“What are you working on today?”
his eyes lit up as he grabbed an
open composition book from his
desk. On it were five lines of
music, lightly penciled in—mainly
dense runs of quarter notes
spanning up and down the octave,
punctuated with the occasional
handwritten explanation. “I’m kinda
working on a new tune,” he
explained. “It’s going to be really
fast.”
Jordan picked up his Martin to
play me the new song. It had the
driving beat of bluegrass, but the
melody, which was inspired by a
Debussy composition, happily
disregards the genre. When Jordan
played, he stared just beyond the
fretboard and breathed in sharp,
sporadic gasps. At one point he
missed a note, which upset him. He
backed up and started again,
insisting on playing until he
finished the full phrase without
mistake.
I told him I was impressed by
the speed of the licks. “No, this is
slow,” he replied. He then showed
me the pace he’s working toward:
It’s at least twice as fast. “I can’t
quite make the lead trail yet,” he
apologized after it slipped away
from him. “I guess I could do it,
but I can’t get the notes to pop out
yet like I want it.” He showed me
how the successive notes in the lead
tend to span many strings,
complicating fast picking. “It’s
really wide.”
At my request, Jordan laid out
his practice regimen for this song.
He starts by playing slow enough
that he can get the effects he
desires: He wants the key notes of
the melody to ring while he fills the
space in between with runs up and
down the fretboard. Then he adds
speed—just enough that he can’t
quite make things work. He repeats
this again and again. “It’s a physical
and mental exercise,” he explained.
“You’re trying to keep track of
different melodies and things. In a
piano, everything is laid out clearly
in front of you; ten fingers never
getting in the way of one another.
On the guitar, you have to budget
your fingers.”
He called his work on this song
his “technical focus” of the
moment. In a typical day, if he’s not
preparing for a show, he’ll practice
with this same intensity, always
playing just a little faster than he’s
comfortable, for two or three hours
straight. I asked him how long it
will take to finally master the new
skill. “Probably like a month,” he
guessed. Then he played through
the lick one more time.
The Craftsman Mindset
Let me be clear about something: I
really don’t care if Jordan Tice
loves what he does. I also don’t
care why he decided to become a
musician or whether he sees guitar
playing as his “passion.” Musicians’
career paths are idiosyncratic, often
relying on unusual circumstances
and lucky breaks early in life. (The
fact that Jordan’s parents are both
bluegrass musicians, for example,
obviously played a big role in his
early dedication to guitar.) Because
of this, I’ve never found the origin
stories of performers’ careers to be
all that relevant to the rest of us.
Here’s what does interest me about
Jordan: how he approaches his
work on a daily basis. Lurking here,
I discovered, is an insight of great
value to my quest for work I love.
The path that led me to Jordan
and the insight he represents began
with a 2007 episode of the Charlie
Rose show. Rose was interviewing
the actor and comedian Steve
Martin about his memoir Born
Standing Up2. They talked about
the realities of Martin’s rise. “I read
autobiographies in general,” Martin
said. “[And I often get frustrated]…
and say, ‘You left out that one part
here, how did you get that audition
for that one thing where suddenly
you’re working at the Copa? How
did that happen?’ ” Martin wrote his
book to answer the “how” question,
at least with respect to his own
success in stand-up. It was in this
explanation of “how” that Martin
introduced a simple idea that
floored me when I first heard it.
The quote comes in the last five
minutes of the interview, when
Rose asks Martin his advice for
aspiring performers.
“Nobody ever takes note of [my
advice], because it’s not the answer
they wanted to hear,” Martin said.
“What they want to hear is ‘Here’s
how you get an agent, here’s how
you write a script,’… but I always
say, ‘Be so good they can’t ignore
you.’ ”
In response to Rose’s trademark
ambiguous grunt, Martin defended
his advice: “If somebody’s
thinking, ‘How can I be really
good?’ people are going to come to
you.”
This is exactly the philosophy
that catapulted Martin into stardom.
He was only twenty years old when
he decided to innovate his act into
something too good to be ignored.
“Comedy at the time was all setup
and punch line… the clichéd
nightclub comedian, rat-a-tat-tat,”
Martin explained to Rose.3 He
thought it could be something more
sophisticated. Here’s how Martin
explained his evolution in an article
he published around the time of his
Charlie Rose interview: “What if
there were no punch lines? What if
there were no indicators? What if I
created tension and never released
it? What if I headed for a climax,
but all I delivered was an
anticlimax?”4 In one famous bit,
Martin tells the audience that it’s
time for his famous nose-on-the-
microphone routine. He then leans
in and puts his nose on the
microphone for several seconds,
steps back, takes a long bow, and
with gravitas thanks the crowd.
“The laugh came not then,” he
explains, “but only after they
realized I had already moved on to
the next bit.”
It took Martin, by his own
estimation, ten years for his new act
to cohere, but when it did, he
became a monster success. It’s clear
in his telling that there was no real
shortcut to his eventual fame.
“[Eventually] you are so
experienced [that] there’s a
confidence that comes out,” Martin
explained. “I think it’s something
the audience smells.”
Be so good they can’t ignore
you. When I first heard this advice,
I was watching the Martin interview
online. It was the winter of 2008
and I was approaching my final
year as a graduate student. At the
time, I had recently started a blog
called Study Hacks, which was
inspired by the pair of student-
advice guides I had published, and
focused mainly on tips for
undergraduates. Soon after hearing
Martin’s axiom, however, I dashed
off a blog post that introduced his
idea to my readers.5 “Sure, it’s
scary,” I concluded. “But, even
more, I find it liberating.”
As my graduate student career
had been winding down, I had
become obsessed with my research
strategy—an obsession that was
manifested in the chronic working
and reworking of the description of
my work on my website. This was a
frustrating process: I felt like I was
stretching to convince the world
that my work was interesting, yet
no one cared. Martin’s axiom gave
me a reprieve from this self-
promotion. “Stop focusing on these
little details,” it told me. “Focus
instead on becoming better.”
Inspired, I turned my attention from
my website to a habit that continues
to this day: I track the hours spent
each month dedicated to thinking
hard about research problems (in
the month in which I first wrote this
chapter, for example, I dedicated
forty-two hours to these core tasks).
This hour-tracking strategy
helped turn my attention back
above all else to the quality of what
I produce. At the same time,
however, it also felt incremental, as
if I hadn’t yet grasped the full
implications of Martin’s radical
idea. When I later launched my
quest to uncover how people end
up loving their work, it didn’t take
long for me to return to Martin’s
advice. Intuitively I grasped that it
played an important role in
constructing a remarkable career.
This is what led me to Jordan Tice:
If I really wanted to understand this
axiom, I figured, I needed to
understand the people who live
their lives by it.
Listening to Tice talk about his
routine, I was struck by his Martin-
esque focus on what he produces.
As you’ll recall, he’s happy to
spend hours every day, week after
week, in a barely furnished
monastic room, exhausting himself
in pursuit of a new flat-picking
technique, all because he thinks it
will add something important to the
tune he’s writing. This dedication to
output, I realized, also explains his
painful modesty. To Jordan,
arrogance doesn’t make sense.
“Here’s what I respect: creating
something meaningful and then
presenting it to the world,” he
explained.
Inspired by meeting Jordan, I got
in touch with Mark Casstevens to
gain a cynical veteran’s perspective
on the performer’s mindset. Mark is
a studio musician from Nashville
who has certainly earned his stripes:
He’s played on ninety-nine number
one hit singles on the Billboard
charts. When I told Mark about
Jordan, he agreed that an obsessive
focus on the quality of what you
produce is the rule in professional
music. “It trumps your appearance,
your equipment, your personality,
and your connections,” he
explained. “Studio musicians have
this adage: ‘The tape doesn’t lie.’
Immediately after the recording
comes the playback; your ability has
no hiding place.”
I liked that phrase—the tape
doesn’t lie—as it sums up nicely
what motivates performers such as
Jordan, Mark, and Steve Martin. If
you’re not focusing on becoming so
good they can’t ignore you, you’re
going to be left behind. This clarity
was refreshing.
To simplify things going
forward, I’ll call this output-centric
approach to work the craftsman
mindset. My goal in Rule #2 is to
convince you of an idea that
became clearer to me the more time
I spent studying performers such as
Tice: Irrespective of what type of
work you do, the craftsman mindset
is crucial for building a career you
love. Before we get ahead of
ourselves, however, I want to take a
moment to contrast this mindset
with the way most of us are used to
thinking about our livelihood.
The Passion Mindset
“[People] thrive by focusing on the
question of who they really are—
and connecting that to work that
they truly love.”6 Po Bronson wrote
this in a 2002 manifesto published
in Fast Company. This should
sound familiar, as it’s exactly the
type of advice you would give if
you subscribed to the passion
hypothesis, which I debunked in
Rule #1. With this in mind, let’s call
the approach to work endorsed by
Bronson the passion mindset.
Whereas the craftsman mindset
focuses on what you can offer the
world, the passion mindset focuses
instead on what the world can offer
you. This mindset is how most
people approach their working
lives.
There are two reasons why I
dislike the passion mindset (that is,
two reasons beyond the fact that, as
I argued in Rule #1, it’s based on a
false premise). First, when you
focus only on what your work
offers you, it makes you
hyperaware of what you don’t like
about it, leading to chronic
unhappiness. This is especially true
for entry-level positions, which, by
definition, are not going to be filled
with challenging projects and
autonomy—these come later. When
you enter the working world with
the passion mindset, the annoying
tasks you’re assigned or the
frustrations of corporate
bureaucracy can become too much
to handle.
Second, and more serious, the
deep questions driving the passion
mindset—“Who am I?” and “What
do I truly love?”—are essentially
impossible to confirm. “Is this who
I really am?” and “Do I love this?”
rarely reduce to clear yes-or-no
responses. In other words, the
passion mindset is almost
guaranteed to keep you perpetually
unhappy and confused, which
probably explains why Bronson
admits, not long into his career-
seeker epic What Should I Do With
My Life? that “the one feeling
everyone in this book has
experienced is of missing out on
life.”7
Adopting the Craftsman Mindset
To summarize, I’ve presented two
different ways people think about
their working life. The first is the
craftsman mindset, which focuses
on what you can offer the world.
The second is the passion mindset,
which instead focuses on what the
world can offer you. The craftsman
mindset offers clarity, while the
passion mindset offers a swamp of
ambiguous and unanswerable
questions. As I concluded after
meeting Jordan Tice, there’s
something liberating about the
craftsman mindset: It asks you to
leave behind self-centered concerns
about whether your job is “just
right,” and instead put your head
down and plug away at getting
really damn good. No one owes
you a great career, it argues; you
need to earn it—and the process
won’t be easy.
With this in mind, it’s only
natural to envy the clarity of
performers like Jordan Tice. But
here’s the core argument of Rule
#2: You shouldn’t just envy the
craftsman mindset, you should
emulate it. In other words, I am
suggesting that you put aside the
question of whether your job is
your true passion, and instead turn
your focus toward becoming so
good they can’t ignore you. That is,
regardless of what you do for a
living, approach your work like a
true performer.
This shift in mindset proved an
exciting development in my own
quest. But as I discovered, it comes
more easily for some than for
others. When I began exploring the
craftsman mindset on my blog,
some of my readers became uneasy.
I noticed them starting to home in
on a common counterargument,
which I should address before we
continue. Here’s how one reader
put it:
Tice is willing to grind out
long hours with little
recognition, but that’s
because it’s in service to
something he’s obviously
passionate about and has
been for a long time. He’s
found that one job that’s
right for him.
I’ve heard this reaction enough
times to give it a name: “the
argument from pre-existing
passion.” At its core is the idea that
the craftsman mindset is only viable
for those who already feel
passionate about their work, and
therefore it cannot be presented as
an alternative to the passion
mindset.
I don’t buy it.
First, let’s dispense with the
notion that performers like Jordan
Tice or Steve Martin are perfectly
secure in their knowledge that
they’ve found their true calling. If
you spend any time with
professional entertainers, especially
those who are just starting out, one
of the first things you notice is their
insecurity concerning their
livelihood. Jordan had a name for
the worries about what his friends
are doing with their lives and
whether his accomplishments
compare favorably: “the cloud of
external distractions.”
Fighting this cloud is an ongoing
battle. Along these lines, Steve
Martin was so unsure during his
decade-long dedication to
improving his routine that he
regularly suffered crippling anxiety
attacks. The source of these
performers’ craftsman mindset is
not some unquestionable inner
passion, but instead something
more pragmatic: It’s what works in
the entertainment business. As
Mark Casstevens put it, “the tape
doesn’t lie”: If you’re a guitar
player or a comedian, what you
produce is basically all that matters.
If you spend too much time
focusing on whether or not you’ve
found your true calling, the
question will be rendered moot
when you find yourself out of
work.
Second, and more fundamental,
I don’t really care why performers
adopt the craftsman mindset. As I
mentioned earlier, their world is
idiosyncratic, and most of what
makes them tick doesn’t generalize.
The reason I focused on Jordan’s
story is that I wanted you to see
what the craftsman mindset looked
like in action. In other words,
forget why Jordan adopted this
mindset and notice instead how he
deploys it. In the next chapter, I will
argue that regardless of how you
feel about your job right now,
adopting the craftsman mindset
will be the foundation on which
you’ll build a compelling career.
This is why I reject the “argument
from pre-existing passion,” because
it gets things backward. In reality,
as I’ll demonstrate, you adopt the
craftsman mindset first and then the
passion follows.
Chapter Five
The Power of Career Capital
In which I justify the importance of
the craftsman mindset by arguing
that the traits that make a great
job great are rare and valuable,
and therefore, if you want a great
job, you need to build up rare and
valuable skills—which I call career
capital—to offer in return.
The Economics of Great Jobs
In the last chapter I offered a bold
proposition: If you want to love
what you do, abandon the passion
mindset (“what can the world offer
me?”) and instead adopt the
craftsman mindset (“what can I
offer the world?”).
My argument for this strategy
starts with a simple question: What
makes a great job great? In
exploring this question, it helps to
get specific. In Rule #1, I provided
several examples of people who
had great jobs and love (or loved)
what they do—so we can draw
from there. Among others, I
introduced Apple founder Steve
Jobs, radio host Ira Glass, and
master surfboard shaper Al
Merrick. Using this trio as our
running example, I can now ask
what it is specifically about these
three careers that makes them so
compelling? Here are the answers
that I came up with:
TRAITS THAT DEFINE GREAT
WORK
Creativity: Ira Glass, for
example, is pushing the
boundaries of radio, and
winning armfuls of awards in
the process.
Impact: From the Apple II to
the iPhone, Steve Jobs has
changed the way we live our
lives in the digital age.
Control: No one tells Al
Merrick when to wake up or
what to wear. He’s not expected
in an office from nine to five.
Instead, his Channel Island
Surfboards factory is located a
block from the Santa Barbara
beach, where Merrick still
regularly spends time surfing. (
Jake Burton Carpenter, founder
of Burton Snowboards, for
example, recalls how
negotiations for the merger
between the two companies
happened while he and Merrick
waited for waves in a surf
lineup.)
This list isn’t comprehensive, but
if consider your own dream-job
fantasies, you’ll likely notice some
combination of these traits. We can
now advance to the question that
really matters: How do you get
these traits in your own working
life? One of the first things I
noticed when I began to study this
question is that these factors are
rare. Most jobs don’t offer their
employees great creativity, impact,
or control over what they do and
how they do it. If you’re a recent
college graduate in an entry-level
job, for example, you’re much
more likely to hear “go change the
water cooler” than you are “go
change the world.”
By definition, we also know that
these traits are valuable—as they’re
the key to making a job great. But
now we’re moving into well-trod
territory. Basic economic theory
tells us that if you want something
that’s both rare and valuable, you
need something rare and valuable to
offer in return—this is Supply and
Demand 101. It follows that if you
want a great job, you need
something of great value to offer in
return. If this is true, of course, we
should see it in the stories of our
trio of examples—and we do. Now
that we know what to look for, this
transactional interpretation of
compelling careers becomes
suddenly apparent.
Consider Steve Jobs. When Jobs
walked into Paul Terrell’s Byte
Shop he was holding something
that was literally rare and valuable:
the circuit board for the Apple I,
one of the more advanced personal
computers in the fledgling market at
the time. The money from selling a
hundred units of that original
design gave Jobs more control in
his career, but in classic economic
terms, to get even more valuable
traits in his working life, he needed
to increase the value of what he had
to offer. It’s at this point that Jobs’s
ascent begins to accelerate. He takes
on $250,000 in funding from Mark
Markkula and works with Steve
Wozniak to produce a new
computer design that is
unambiguously too good to be
ignored. There were other engineers
in the Bay Area’s Homebrew
Computer Club culture who could
match Jobs’s and Wozniak’s
technical skill, but Jobs had the
insight to take on investment and to
focus this technical energy toward
producing a complete product. The
result was the Apple II, a machine
that leaped ahead of the
competition: It had color graphics;
the monitor and keyboard were
integrated inside the case; the
architecture was open, allowing
rapid expansion of memory and
peripherals (such as the floppy
disk, which the Apple II was the
first to introduce into mainstream
use). This was the product that put
the company on the map and that
pushed Jobs from a small-time
entrepreneur into the head of a
visionary company. He produced
something of great value and in
return his career got an injection of
creativity, impact, and control.
The radio host Ira Glass was
given the opportunity to create his
genre-defining radio show This
American Life only after he had
proven himself as one of public
radio’s best editors and hosts. Glass
started as an intern and then moved
on to become a tape cutter for All
Things Considered. There are many
young people who start down the
same path as Glass: landing an
internship at a local NPR station
and then moving up to a low-level
production position. But Glass
began to break away from the pack
when he turned his focus on
making his skills more rare and
more valuable. The crispness of his
segment editing eventually gained
him the opportunity to host a few
of his own segments on air. And
even though Glass has a voice that
mocks everything sacred about
what a radio personality should
sound like, he began to win awards
for his segments. It’s possible that a
latent natural talent for editing may
be playing a role here, but recall
from Rule #1 that Glass emphasizes
the importance of the hard work
required to develop skill. “All of us
who do creative work… you get
into this thing, and there’s like a
‘gap.’ What you’re making isn’t so
good, okay?… It’s trying to be
good but… it’s just not that great,”
he explained in an interview about
his career.1 “The key thing is to
force yourself through the work,
force the skills to come; that’s the
hardest phase,” he elaborated in his
Roadtrip Nation session. In other
words, this is not the story of a
prodigy who walked into a radio
station after college and walked out
with a show. The more you read
about Glass, the more you
encounter a young man who was
driven to develop his skills until
they were too valuable to be
ignored.
This strategy worked. After the
success of his short segments for
All Things Considered, Glass was
tapped to cohost a string of
different local shows produced out
of Chicago’s WBEZ station, further
increasing the value of his skills. In
1995, when the station manager at
WBEZ decided to put together a
free-form show with any eye
toward national syndication—a
show called This American Life—
Glass was at the top of his list. His
career today is rich with creativity,
impact, and control, but when you
read his story, the economic
undertones are unmistakable. Glass
exchanged a collection of hard-
won, rare, and valuable skills for
his fantastic job.
With Al Merrick, not
surprisingly, we get the same style
of story. The rare and valuable skill
that launched Merrick’s career as a
professional surfboard shaper is
crystal clear: His boards won
competitions. What’s important to
note is that this was not always the
case. Merrick picked up the trade of
fiberglass shaping from his years
spent as a boatbuilder, and he knew
about surfing from his own on-
again, off-again relationship with
the sport, but it took an abundance
of hard work to get his board-
crafting skills to the place where
they were valuable. “[Starting out,]
a lot of time you’re afraid that
you’re going to be a failure, that
this guy you’re making a board for
is a world champion and his boards
[won’t be] working right,” he
recalled in his Roadtrip Nation
session. “It just makes me work
harder and try harder to accomplish
what I’m trying to accomplish with
a surfboard.” Having an office a
block from the beach, with the
freedom to take off to surf on a
moment’s notice, sounds great, but
it’s not the type of job that is just
being handed out. To get it, Merrick
realized he needed a rare and
valuable skill to offer in exchange.
Once he had surf pros like Kelly
Slater riding his boards—and
winning—he became free to dictate
the terms of his working life.
Here, then, are the main strands
of my argument:
THE CAREER CAPITAL
THEORY OF GREAT WORK
The traits that define great
work are rare and valuable.
Supply and demand says that if
you want these traits you need
rare and valuable skills to offer
in return. Think of these rare
and valuable skills you can
offer as your career capital.
The craftsman mindset, with its
relentless focus on becoming
“so good they can’t ignore
you,” is a strategy well suited
for acquiring career capital.
This is why it trumps the
passion mindset if your goal is
to create work you love.
Jobs, Glass, and Merrick all
adopted the craftsman mindset.
(Some even use these exact words
in describing themselves. “I was a
craftsman,” said Merrick, in an
interview on his early days as a
board shaper.2) Career capital
theory tells us that this is no
coincidence. The traits that define
great work require that you have
something rare and valuable to
offer in return—skills I call career
capital. The craftsman mindset,
with its relentless focus on what
you produce, is exactly the mindset
you would adopt if your goal was
to acquire as much career capital as
possible. Ultimately, this is why I
promote the craftsman mindset over
the passion mindset. This is not
some philosophical debate on the
existence of passion or the value of
hard work—I’m being intensely
pragmatic: You need to get good in
order to get good things in your
working life, and the craftsman
mindset is focused on achieving
exactly this goal.
But there is, I must admit, a
darker corollary to this argument.
The passion mindset is not just
ineffective for creating work you
love; in many cases it can actively
work against this goal, sometimes
with devastating consequences.
From Courage to Food Stamps
A pair of articles, published within
two days of each other in the New
York Times in the summer of 2009,
emphasize the contrast between the
passion mindset and the craftsman
mindset. The first article concerned
Lisa Feuer3. At the age of thirty-
eight, Feuer quit her career in
advertising and marketing. Chafing
under the constraints of corporate
life, she started to question whether
this was her calling. “I’d watched
my husband go into business for
himself, and I felt like I could do it,
too,” she said. So she decided to
give entrepreneurship a try.
As reported by the Times, Feuer
enrolled in a two-hundred-hour
yoga instruction course, tapping a
home equity loan to pay the $4,000
tuition. Certification in hand, she
started Karma Kids Yoga, a yoga
practice focused on young children
and pregnant women. “I love what I
do,” she told the reporter when
justifying the difficulties of starting
a freelance business.
The passion mindset supports
Feuer’s decision. To those
enthralled by the myth of a true
calling, there’s nothing more heroic
than trading comfort for passion.
Consider, for example, the author
Pamela Slim, a believer in the
passion mindset who wrote the
popular book Escape from Cubicle
Nation.4 Slim describes on her
website the following sample
dialogue, which she claims she has
often:
Me: So are you ready to
move forward with your
plan?
Them: I know what I have to
do, but I don’t know if I
can do it! Who am I to
pretend to be a successful
(artist) (coach) (consultant)
(masseuse)? What if
everyone looks at my
website and laughs
hysterically that I would
even consider selling my
services? Why would
anyone ever want to
connect with me?
Me: Time for a little work on
your backbone.5
Motivated by these encounters,
Slim launched a phone-seminar
product called Rebuild Your
Backbone. Its goal is to convince
more people to be like Lisa Feuer
by finding the courage to follow
their dreams. The course
description says Slim will answer
questions like “Why do we get
stuck living other people’s models
of success?” and “How do we get
the courage to do big things in the
world?” It costs forty-seven dollars.
Rebuild Your Backbone is an
example of the courage culture, a
growing community of authors and
online commentators pushing the
following idea: The biggest obstacle
between you and work you love is
a lack of courage—the courage
required to step away from “other
people’s definition of success” and
to follow your dream. It’s an idea
that makes perfect sense when
presented against the backdrop of
the passion mindset: If there’s some
perfect job waiting for us out there,
every day we’re not following this
passion is a wasted day. When
viewed from this perspective,
Feuer’s move appears courageous
and long overdue; she could be a
guest lecturer in Pamela Slim’s
teleseminar. But this idea crumbles
when viewed from the perspective
of career capital theory—a
perspective that makes Karma Kids
Yoga suddenly seem like a poor
gamble.
The downside of the passion
mindset is that it strips away merit.
For passion proponents like Slim,
launching a freelance career that
gives you control, creativity, and
impact is easy—it’s just the act of
getting started that trips us up.
Career capital theory disagrees. It
tells us that great work doesn’t just
require great courage, but also skills
of great (and real) value. When
Feuer left her advertising career to
start a yoga studio, not only did she
discard the career capital acquired
over many years in the marketing
industry, but she transitioned into
an unrelated field where she had
almost no capital. Given yoga’s
popularity, a one-month training
program places Feuer pretty near
the bottom of the skill hierarchy of
yoga practitioners, making her a
long way from being so good she
can’t be ignored. According to
career capital theory, she therefore
has very little leverage in her yoga-
working life. It’s unlikely,
therefore, that things will go well
for Feuer—which, unfortunately, is
exactly what ended up happening.
As the recession hit in 2008,
Feuer’s business struggled. One of
the gyms where she taught closed.
Then two classes she offered at a
local public high school were
dropped, and with the tightening
economy, demands for private
lessons diminished. In 2009, when
she was profiled for the Times, she
was on track to make only $15,000
for the year. Toward the conclusion
of the profile, Feuer sends the
reporter a text message: “I’m at the
food stamp office now, waiting.”
It’s signed: “Sent from my iPhone.”
Two days after Lisa Feuer’s
profile was published, the Times
introduced its readers to another
marketing executive, Joe Duffy.6
Like Feuer, Duffy worked in
advertising and eventually began to
chafe at the constraints of corporate
life. “I was tired of the agency
business,” he recalls. “I [wanted] to
simplify my life and focus on the
creative side again.” Given that
Duffy’s original training was as an
artist—he had entered the
advertising industry as a technical
illustrator only after he had a hard
time making a living with his
paintings—supporters of the
passion mindset might encourage
someone in Duffy’s situation to
leave advertising behind and return
to his passion for the creative arts.
Duffy, it turns out, is from the
craftsman school of thought.
Instead of fleeing the constraints of
his current job, he began acquiring
the career capital he’d need to buy
himself out of them. His specialty
became international logos and
brand icons. As his ability grew, so
did his options. Eventually, he was
hired away by the Minneapolis-
based Fallon McElligott agency,
which allowed him to run his own
subsidiary within the larger
organization, calling it Duffy
Designs. In other words, his capital
had bought him more autonomy.
After twenty years at Fallon
McElligott, working on logos for
major companies such as Sony and
Coca-Cola, Duffy once again
invested his capital to gain more
autonomy, this time by starting his
own fifteen-person shop: Duffy &
Partners. This entrepreneurial move
contrasts sharply with Feuer’s.
Duffy started his own company
with enough career capital to
immediately thrive—he was one of
the world’s best logo men and had
a waiting list of clients. Feuer
started her company with only two
hundred hours of training and an
abundance of courage.
It’s fair to guess that by the time
Duffy recently retired, he loved
what he did. His work gave him
heaps of control and respect and,
depending on your view of the
importance of advertising, also had
a great impact on the world. To me,
however, the most vivid contrast to
Feuer’s story was Duffy’s purchase
of Duffy Trails, a hundred-acre
retreat on the banks of Wisconsin’s
Totagatic River. Duffy is an avid
cross-country skier, and the five
miles of wooded trails, skiable from
November through March, made
the retreat irresistible. As reported
by the New York Times, the
property can comfortably house at
least twenty guests, spread over
three different residential
outbuildings, but on the hottest
summer nights, it’s the screened
gazebo by the retreat’s sixteen-acre,
bass-stocked lake that attracts the
most visitors.
Duffy purchased this property at
the age of forty-five: in other
words, not long after the age at
which Feuer left advertising to
pursue her yoga business. It’s this
parallel that gives this pair of stories
their Frostian undertones. “Two
roads diverged in a yellow wood,”
and one traveler chose the path to
mastery while the other was called
toward passion’s glow. The former
ended up celebrated in the industry,
in control of his own livelihood,
and weekending with his family in
a forested retreat. The latter ended
up on food stamps.
This comparison is not
necessarily fair. We don’t know that
Feuer could have replicated Duffy’s
success if she had stayed in
marketing and advertising and had
focused her restless energy on
becoming excellent. But as a
metaphor, the story works nicely.
The image of Feuer, waiting in line
for food stamps, while Duffy, at a
similar age, returns from a
successful overseas trip to spend a
relaxing weekend skiing at Duffy
Trails, is striking. It captures well
both the risk and the illogic of
starting from scratch as contrasted
with the leverage gained by instead
acquiring more career capital. Both
Feuer and Duffy had the same
issues with their work; these issues
emerged at around the same time;
and they both had the same desire
to love what they do. But they had
two different approaches to tackling
these issues. In the end, it was
Duffy’s commitment to
craftsmanship that was the obvious
winner.
When Craftsmanship Fails
Not long before I started writing
this chapter, I received an e-mail
from John, a recent college
graduate and longtime reader of my
blog. He was concerned about his
new job as a tax consultant. Though
he found the work to be
“sometimes interesting,” the hours
were long and the tasks were
fiercely prescribed, making it
difficult to stand out. “Aside from
not liking the lifestyle,” John
complained, “I’m concerned that
my work doesn’t serve a larger
purpose, and, in fact, that it actively
hurts the most vulnerable.”
This chapter has argued in favor
of the craftsman mindset and
against its passion-centric
alternative. Part of what makes the
craftsman mindset thrilling is its
agnosticism toward the type of
work you do. The traits that define
great work are bought with career
capital, the theory argues; they don’t
come from matching your work to
your innate passion. Because of
this, you don’t have to sweat
whether you’ve found your calling
—most any work can become the
foundation for a compelling career.
John had heard this argument and
wrote me because he was having a
hard time applying it to his life as a
tax consultant. He didn’t like his
work and he wanted to know if,
like a good craftsman, he should
just suck it up and continue to
focus on getting good. This is an
important question, and here’s what
I told John:
“It sounds like you should leave
your job.” On reflection, it became
clear to me that certain jobs are
better suited for applying career
capital theory than others. To aid
John, I ended up devising a list of
three traits that disqualify a job as
providing a good foundation for
building work you love:
THREE DISQUALIFIERS FOR
APPLYING THE CRAFTSMAN
MINDSET
1. The job presents few
opportunities to distinguish
yourself by developing relevant
skills that are rare and valuable.
2. The job focuses on something
you think is useless or perhaps
even actively bad for the world.
3. The job forces you to work
with people you really dislike.7
A job with any combination of
these disqualifying traits can thwart
your attempts to build and invest
career capital. If it satisfies the first
trait, skill growth isn’t possible. If it
satisfies the second two traits, then
even though you could build up
reserves of career capital, you’ll
have a hard time sticking around
long enough to accomplish this
goal. John’s job satisfied the first
two traits, so he needed to leave.
To give another example: As a
computer scientist at MIT, which I
was while writing this book, I got
quite a few e-mails from Wall Street
headhunters. They were hiring for
jobs that provide plenty of room to
develop skills and they’re not afraid
to compensate you well for your
time. “There is a small handful of
firms on Wall Street that pay better
than everyone else, about three or
four of them,” said one headhunter
who wrote me recently. “This
company is one of them.” (I was
later told by friends that the starting
salary for these firms was in the
two to three hundred thousand
dollar range.) But to me, these firms
satisfy the second condition listed
above. This realization allowed me
to confidently delete these offers as
they arrived.
The big-picture point worth
noting here, however, is that these
disqualifying traits still have
nothing to do with whether a job is
the right fit for some innate passion.
They remain much more general.
Working right, therefore, still
trumps finding the right work.
Now that I’ve made my pitch for
the craftsman mindset, and
moderated it with the exceptions
listed above, it’s time to see it in
action.
Chapter Six
The Career Capitalists
In which I demonstrate the power
of career capital in action with two
profiles of people who leveraged
the craftsman mindset to construct
careers they love.
Two Career Capitalists
Alex Berger is thirty-one: He’s a
successful television writer and he
loves his work. Mike Jackson is
twenty-nine: He’s a cleantech
venture capitalist and he also loves
his work. This chapter is dedicated
to telling their stories, as they both
highlight the somewhat messy
reality of using the craftsman
mindset to generate fantastic
livelihoods. Alex and Mike both
focused on getting good—not
finding their passion—and then
used the career capital this
generated to acquire the traits that
made their careers compelling.
The Closed-Off World of
Television Kabillionaires
Let’s assume for the moment that
you want to be hired as a television
writer on a network series. Your
first step is to get past someone like
Jamie.
Jamie, who is in his late twenties,
was recently involved in the writer-
staffing process for a network
show. He agreed to provide me a
glimpse into his world so long as I
kept him and his show anonymous.
Here’s what I learned: TV writing is
not an easy gig to land. According
to Jamie, the process unfolds as
follows. First, the producers put out
a call to talent agencies to send over
sample scripts from their writers.
For his particular show, Jamie
received around a hundred
packages, each containing a sample
script, which Jamie read, reviewed,
and graded. Only around the best
twenty or so from this pile will be
passed on to the producers for
additional consideration. Keep in
mind that the producers have
already hired their favored veteran
writers, so there are precious few
spots left to be filled from this open
call.
To provide a sense of the
competitiveness of this process,
Jamie sent me a copy of his script
evaluations. Out of the hundred or
so writers who submitted scripts, all
but fourteen sent a script that had
already been produced and aired on
television. Of the fourteen who had
not yet broken into the industry, the
highest score any received from
Jamie was a 6.5 out of 10. Most of
this group, however, fared much
worse. “It was flat, without any
interesting storytelling, engaging
act-outs, or smart dialogue,” he
wrote about one such script (score:
4 out of 10). “I only read about a
quarter of this script but it’s clearly
pretty subpar,” he said about
another.
In other words, getting on the
inside in the world of television
writing is daunting. But at the same
time, I can understand why so
many thousands aspire to this goal:
It’s a fantastic job. For one thing,
there’s the money. As a new writer,
your salary starts modest. The
Writer’s Guild of America
guarantees that you make at least
$2,500 a week, which, given a
standard twenty-six week season, is
decent for half a year of work.
Depending on the success of the
series, you’ll then progress after a
year or two to become a story
editor, where, as a longtime TV
writer explained in a Salon.com
article on the topic, “you’re still
making shit” (though, as another
writer admitted, “shit” at this point
qualifies as over $10,000 an
episode).1 Things start to get
interesting when you make it to the
next level: producer. Once there,
“you’re in the money.” Top writers
can pull in seven-figure paychecks.
In the Salon.com article referenced
above, the term “kabillionaire” was
used by multiple people to describe
the salaries of producers on long-
running shows.
Of course, you can also make
lots of money in other jobs. A fast
riser at Goldman Sachs can hit the
seven-figure mark (including
bonuses) by his or her midthirties,
and a partner at a prestigious law
firm can get somewhere similar a
few years later. But the difference
between Wall Street and Hollywood
in the style of work is staggering.
Imagine: no e-mail, no late-night
contract negotiations, no need to
master intricate bond markets or
legal precedents. As a writer your
whole focus is on one thing: telling
good stories. The work can be
intense, as you’re often under
deadline to deliver the next script,
but it only lasts half a year, and it’s
immensely creative, and you can
wear shorts, and the catered food,
as was emphasized to me several
times, is fantastic. (“Writers are
crazy about their food,” one source
explained.) To recast the job in the
terms I introduced in the last
chapter, television writing is
attractive because it has the three
traits that make people love their
work: impact, creativity, and
control.
By the time I met him, Alex
Berger had managed to break into
this elite world. He had recently
sold a pilot to USA Network. To
sell a pilot is to sell an idea: You sit
down in a room with three or four
executives from the network and
spend five minutes pitching your
vision. At a cable network like
USA, these executives will hear
around fifteen to twenty such
pitches a week. They then retreat to
a staff meeting and choose three or
four to actually buy. Alex’s idea
was one of the four they bought
that week.
Alex has a few more hurdles to
leap before his show makes it on
the air at USA, but selling a pilot,
by itself, is seen as impressive in
the industry—a mark that you
know what you’re doing. As if to
emphasize this impressiveness, one
of the executives at USA, who liked
Alex’s work, helped staff him on an
already running show, the hit spy
drama Covert Affairs, so that he’d
have something to do while waiting
for the pilot decisions to be made.
Not that Alex needed the boost to
his reputation: He had already
written and aired episodes for three
different shows leading up to this
point. His latest gig was on the stop-
motion comedy Glenn Martin,
DDS, which he had cocreated with
Michael Eisner and had run for two
seasons. In other words, there’s no
doubt that Alex is an established
writer in an industry that allows few
through its gates.
The question is, how did he do
it?
How Alex Berger Broke into
Hollywood
What makes television a hard
industry to crack is the fact that it’s
a winner-take-all market. There’s
only one type of career capital here,
the quality of your writing, and
there are thousands of hopefuls
trying to gain enough of this capital
to impress a very small group of
buyers.
In this respect, however, Alex
had an advantage. At Dartmouth
College he had been a debater, and
a damn good one at that: In 2002
his two-man team arrived at the
National Debate Tournament with
the country’s highest rank; Alex
then went on to win the Best
Speaker prize at the tournament. In
debate, as in television writing,
there’s no mystery about what
separates good from bad: The
scoring system is specific and
known. To become the country’s
best debater, therefore, Alex had to
master the art of continual
improvement. Hearing the story of
how he then went on to succeed in
Hollywood convinced me that it
was exactly this skill that fueled his
fast rise.
When Alex made the decision to
move to Hollywood, his logic, in
typical debater fashion, was airtight:
“I figured I could always apply to
law school,” he recalled thinking,
“but realistically this would be my
only chance to try out writing.”
Alex admits that when he first
moved west he wasn’t even sure
what his goals were: “I had a
number of things I wanted to do,
but didn’t know what they meant. I
thought I wanted to be a network
executive, for example, but had no
idea what that involved. I thought I
might be a TV writer, but didn’t
know what that meant either.” This
was not a classic case of the young
man building the courage to follow
his unmistakable passion.
When Alex first arrived in LA,
he took a job as website editor for
the National Lampoon. Once there,
he discovered that the Lampoon
was also interested in television
production. Drawing from the
adage “write what you know,” Alex
pitched them Master Debaters, a
show that required comedians to
debate humorous topics in front of
a panel of judges. He was given a
modest amount of money to film a
pilot, which he did, in a Border’s
bookstore in Westwood. But
making television shows is a tough
game, and the National Lampoon’s
tentative effort didn’t go anywhere.
What I like about Alex’s story is
what he does next: He quit his job
at the National Lampoon and took
a position as an assistant to a
development executive at NBC. It’s
here that I see Alex’s debater
instincts stir back to life. The
National Lampoon was too far to
the periphery of the industry to
teach him what it takes to succeed.
By accepting an assistant position
he threw himself into the center of
the action, where he could find out
how things actually work.
It didn’t take long for Alex to
discover what allows some writers
to succeed in catching the attention
of a network while so many others
fail: They write good scripts—a
task that’s more difficult than many
imagine. Spurred by this insight,
Alex turned his attention to writing.
Lots of writing. During the eight
months he spent as an assistant he
dedicated his nights to working on
a trio of different writing projects.
First, before Alex left the National
Lampoon, they had optioned his
Master Debaters idea to VH1—
while an assistant Alex was still
polishing the script for the VH1
version of the pilot. (In the end,
like most pilots, nothing ever came
of the VH1 option.) At the same
time, he was working on a pilot for
an unrelated show along with a
producer he had met at the
Lampoon. And on his own, he was
writing a screenplay about his life
growing up in Washington, D.C. “I
might finish writing at two or three
A.M., then have to leave at eight the
next morning to get back to my job
at NBC on time,” Alex recalls. It
was a busy period.
After eight months as an
assistant, Alex heard about a job
opening for a script assistant on
Commander in Chief, a West Wing
copycat helmed by Geena Davis. He
jumped at the chance to observe
professional TV writers up close,
even though it was still a low-level
position. On the side, he also added
to his portfolio a spec script-in-
progress for the HBO series Curb
Your Enthusiasm, aggressively
seeking feedback on his early
drafts. “I thought I needed more
samples to get work,” he recalls.
While working as a script
assistant for Commander in Chief,
Alex started to pitch episode ideas
to the room: One of the privileges
of being a script assistant is that you
can always get a (quick)
consideration of your pitch. Not
long before the show was canceled,
he finally caught the attention of the
room with an episode idea about
lost missiles from a plane crash in
Pakistan and the political fallout of
a gay commitment ceremony.
Working with Cynthia Cohen, one
of the staff writers on the show, he
produced a draft of the episode.
“For those with free TiVo space,
I recommend giving the ‘thumbs
up’ to a groundbreaking episode of
Commander in Chief, this Thursday
at ten,” Alex wrote in an e-mail to
friends around this time. “Why
groundbreaking, you ask? Because,
within the first ten minutes, for the
first time in the history of network
television, the words ‘Alex’ and
‘Berger’ will appear—in succession,
mind you—just underneath the
words ‘written by.’ ”
With his first produced television
script now in hand, things began to
move quickly for Alex. After
Commander in Chief was canceled,
he took another low-level job, this
time working with the producer
Jonathan Lisco in the run-up for his
new show, K-Ville, a post-Katrina
New Orleans drama being
developed for Fox. Given his
writing credit, however, and a
collection of increasingly polished
spec scripts, this job became an
informal tryout for Alex: He was
given the chance to impress Lisco—
which he did. When a spot opened
on the writing staff for K-Ville, it
was given to Alex: his first official
position as a staff writer. He went
on to write and air two episodes
before the show was canceled.
After K-Ville, a mutual friend set
up a meeting between Alex and
Michael Eisner, who, fresh from
leaving Disney, was looking to
create a television comedy as his
first project as an independent
producer. Alex got the meeting
because he was a former staff
writer for a network show, but it
was his Curb Your Enthusiasm
script that convinced Eisner to ask
him to write a pilot for his new
idea. Eisner liked the pilot draft,
and Alex went on to help him
cocreate the show, Glenn Martin,
DDS, which aired for two seasons
as a flagship program for
Nickelodeon’s “Nick at Night”
block.
It was as Glenn Martin was
winding down that Alex sold his
pilot to USA and was staffed on
one of their hit shows, Covert
Affairs—the setting where I first
introduced him to you.
Alex’s Capital
To understand Alex Berger’s
various breaks, you need to
understand the career capital that
enabled them. For example, it was
certainly a big deal for Michael
Eisner to ask Alex to help him
create a show, but think about what
this break required: At the time,
Alex had been a staff writer for a
network show and had a quality-
comedy spec script—polished over
many rounds of aggressive
feedback—in his portfolio. That’s
an important collection of capital.
If you rewind the clock more
and ask how Alex got a staff spot
on K-Ville, you once again discover
a capital transaction: He had already
written and aired an episode of
another network drama,
Commander in Chief. Another
important collection of capital.
Rewind the clock further and ask
how Alex, as a lowly script
assistant, got a script aired on
Commander in Chief, and you
encounter the writing skill he had
developed over the previous years
spent obsessively honing his craft—
a period where he was often
working on three or four scripts at a
time, always seeking feedback for
how he could make them better.
The Alex Berger who first arrived
in LA, fresh out of college, did not
have this writing-skill capital. By
the time he was working for
Commander in Chief, however, he
was ready for his first major
transaction.
In this telling, the story of Alex’s
fast rise is not one of passion
triumphing over setbacks: It’s much
less dramatic. Alex, the former
debate champion, coolly assessed
what career capital was valuable in
this market. He then set out with the
intensity once reserved for debate
prep to acquire this capital as fast as
possible. What this story lacks in
pizazz, it makes up in repeatability:
There’s nothing mysterious about
how Alex Berger broke into
Hollywood—he simply understood
the value, and difficulty, of
becoming good.
The Most Desirable Job in Silicon
Valley
Mike Jackson is a director at the
Westly Group, a cleantech venture
capital firm on Silicon Valley’s
famous Sand Hill Road. To say that
Mike has a desirable job is an
understatement. “I have a friend
who recently had dinner with the
dean in charge of a top-tier business
school,” he told me. “And at this
dinner, the dean said that everyone
in their graduating class right now
wants to be a cleantech VC.” Mike
has experienced this firsthand: He
receives dozens of e-mails from
business school students asking him
about his path. He used to try to
answer them, but now, due to time
constraints, he mostly ignores them.
“Everyone wants my job,” he
explained.
The fact that people covet his
position isn’t surprising. Clean
energy is hot. It’s a way to help the
world while at the same time, as
Mike admitted, “you make a lot of
money.” In his position, Mike has
traveled the world, met senators,
and spent time with the mayors of
both Sacramento and Los Angeles.
During one of our conversations,
he mentioned that David Plouffe,
Barack Obama’s campaign
manager, had been “hanging around
the office.”
What interests me about Mike is
that, like Alex Berger, he didn’t
arrive at his outstanding job by
following a clear passion. Instead
he carefully and persistently
gathered career capital, confident
that valuable skills would translate
into valuable opportunities. Unlike
Alex, however, Mike started
gathering capital before he knew
what he wanted to do with it. In
fact, he had never given a
moment’s thought to cleantech
venture capital until a couple weeks
before his first interview.
How Mike Jackson Became a
Venture Capitalist
Mike majored in biology and earth
systems at Stanford. After earning
his bachelor’s degree, Mike elected
to stay for a fifth year to earn a
master’s. The professor who
supervised his master’s was trying
to decide whether or not to launch a
major research project studying the
natural-gas sector in India, so he
arranged Mike’s thesis to act as an
exploration of the project’s
viability. In the fall of 2005, after
Mike finished his graduate degree,
his supervisor decided he liked
what he saw and launched the
major research project. Not
surprisingly, he asked Mike to help
him lead it—at this point, Mike had
just spent a year getting up to speed
on its details.
Mike, who is competitive by
nature, tackled the project with
intensity, driven by the belief that
the better he did now, the better his
options would be later. “During this
time, I traveled to India ten times
and to China four to five times, in
addition to quite a bit of travel in
Europe,” he recalls. “I met with the
heads of major utilities, and I
learned how the global energy
market really works.” When the
project concluded in the fall of
2007, Mike and his professor held a
major international conference to
release and discuss the results.
Academics and government
officials from around the world
attended.
With the project complete, Mike
had to decide what to do next. Of
the many valuable skills he picked
up from the project, one in
particular was a “deep
understanding” of how the
international carbon market works.
As part of this expertise, he learned
that the United States had an
obscure exchange, known as the
renewable energy credits market.
“Almost no one understood these
things; it was a really fractured
market with huge information
asymmetry,” he recalls. Being one
of the few people who actually
knew how this market worked,
Mike decided to start a business. He
called it Village Green. The idea
was simple: You give money to
Mike, he does complicated
transactions that only he and a few
other energy regulation wonks
really understand, and then he
offers you certification that you’ve
purchased enough carbon offsets
for your business to be deemed
carbon neutral.
Mike ran this business for two
years along with a friend from
Stanford and a rotating series of
other partners. They were
headquartered in a rental house not
far from where he lived in San
Francisco. The company never
struggled to pay its expenses, but it
also never became a thriving
concern. So when the economy
went sour in 2009, Mike and his
partner decided to shutter it instead
of hunkering down and trying to
ride out the recession.
“We decided to get real jobs,” is
how Mike describes what happened
next. Here’s how the process
unfolded: A stand-up comedian
friend of Mike’s had a girlfriend
who was interviewing at a venture
capital firm. She decided not to take
the job, but recommended that they
talk to Mike. “She thought I would
be a good fit for venture capital,
given my experience with my
company,” he said. Mike knew that
he was not a good match for this
technology-focused fund. “I have
no idea how to find the next
Facebook,” he told me, “but I could
tell you if a solar energy firm was
probably going to make money.”
He figured, however, that since he
had never been through a real job
interview before, the experience
would provide good practice.
“The interview was pretty low-
key, because we both realized early
on I wasn’t going to get this job,
but we hit it off on a personal level”
he recalls. At some point in the
discussion, the venture capitalist
had an idea. “You know, you
would be a good match for this
cleantech fund that’s starting up,”
he said. “Why don’t I introduce you
to my friend over there?”
In the summer of 2009, Mike
started a trial period as an intern at
the Westly Group. In October they
gave him a full-time position as an
analyst, and soon after, he was
promoted to associate. Two years
later he became a director. “When
people ask me how I got my job,”
he now jokes, “I tell them to make
friends with a comedian.”
Mike’s Capital
Mike Jackson leveraged the
craftsman mindset to do whatever
he did really well, thus ensuring
that he came away from each
experience with as much career
capital as possible. He never had
elaborate plans for his career.
Instead, after each working
experience, he would stick his head
up to see who was interested in his
newly expanded store of capital,
and then jump at whatever
opportunity seemed most
promising.
One could argue that luck also
played an important role in Mike’s
story. He was, for example, lucky to
find a personal connection to a
venture capitalist and then to hit it
off when they met in person. But
these types of small breaks are
common. What mattered most in
Mike’s story is that once he
stumbled through the door, his
career capital went to work getting
him a fantastic job offer.
If you spend time around Mike,
you quickly realize how serious he
is about doing what he does well.
It’s true that he now loves his work,
but he’s still quick to turn the
conversation back to how he
approaches it. As you’ll learn more
about in the next chapter, Mike
literally tracks every hour of his
day, down to quarter-hour
increments, on a spreadsheet. He
wants to ensure that his attention is
focused on the activities that matter.
“It’s so easy to just come in and
spend your whole day on e-mail,”
he warned. On the sample
spreadsheet he sent me, he allots
himself only ninety minutes per day
for e-mail. The day before we last
spoke he had only spent forty-five.
This is a man who is serious about
doing what he does really well.
In the end, Mike’s focus on
capabilities over callings obviously
paid off. He has a fantastic job, but
it was one that required a fantastic
store of career capital to be offered
in exchange.
Chapter Seven
Becoming a Craftsman
In which I introduce deliberate
practice, the key strategy for
acquiring career capital, and show
how to integrate it into your own
working life.
Why Is Jordan Tice a Better Guitar
Player than Me?
Jordan Tice and I both started
playing guitar at the age of twelve.
After receiving my first guitar, I
formed a band and several months
later performed my first
“concert”—a reduced-speed
interpretation of Nirvana’s “All
Apologies,” played to polite
applause at the Tollgate Grammar
School sixth-grade talent show.
After this I got serious: I took
lessons throughout junior high
school and high school. I played
every day—sometimes rocking
blues solos to Hendrix recordings
for hours at a time. My band, which
had the questionable name of
Rocking Chair, played around a
dozen shows a year: festivals,
parties, competitions—anywhere,
really, that people would allow us
to set up our equipment. We once
played a gig in a graveyard facing a
parking lot. Our drummer’s mom
videotaped it. When she pans the
camera from our setup in front of
the graves to the lot, you realize that
the “crowd” consists of no more
than a dozen people on folding
chairs. She still finds it funny to
play this tape.
By the time I graduated high
school I could play from a
repertoire of hundreds of songs,
ranging from Green Day to Pink
Floyd. In other words, I had
reached the level of expertise you
would expect from someone who
had played an instrument seriously
for the last six years. But this is
what I find fascinating: Compared
to Jordan Tice’s ability at this same
age, I was mediocre.
Jordan picked up guitar at the
same point in his life as I did. But
by the time he graduated high
school, he had been touring the
mid-Atlantic with a group of
professional bluegrass musicians
and had signed his first record deal.
When I was in high school, the
acoustic group Nickel Creek was
thought of, admiringly, by my
grade’s music snobs as Dave
Matthews for cool people. When
Jordan was in high school, he
regularly played gigs with their bass
player, Mark Schatz. The question
hanging over this comparison is
why, even though we had both
played seriously for the same
amount of time, did I end up an
average high school strummer
while Jordan became a star?
It didn’t take long into my visit
with Jordan to understand the
answer to this question. The
difference in our abilities by the age
of eighteen had less to do with the
number of hours we practiced—
though he probably racked up more
total practice hours than I did, we
weren’t all that far apart—and more
to do with what we did with those
hours. One of my most vivid
memories of Rocking Chair, for
example, was my discomfort
playing anything I didn’t know real
well. There’s a mental strain that
accompanies feeling your way
though a tune that’s not ingrained in
muscle memory, and I hated that
feeling. I learned songs reluctantly,
then clung to them fiercely once
they had become easy for me. I
used to get upset when our rhythm
guitar player would suggest we try
out something new during band
practice. He was happy glancing at a
chord chart and then jumping in. I
wasn’t. Even at that young age I
realized that my discomfort with
mental discomfort was a liability in
the performance world.
Compare this to Jordan’s earliest
experiences with the guitar. His first
teacher was a friend from his
parents’ church. As Jordan
remembers, their lessons focused
on picking out the leads from
Allman Brothers records. “So he
would write out the lead and then
you would go memorize them?” I
asked. “No, we would just figure
them out by ear,” Jordan replied.
To the high school version of
myself, the idea of learning
complicated lead parts by ear would
have been way past my threshold of
mental strain and patience. But
Jordan came to enjoy this labor. In
our interview, a decade beyond his
high school years, Jordan at one
point grabbed his old Martin and
knocked off the solo from
“Jessica,” which he somehow still
remembered. “Great melody,” he
said.
Not only did Jordan’s early
practice require him to constantly
stretch himself beyond what was
comfortable, but it was also
accompanied by instant feedback.
The teacher was always there,
Jordan explained, “to jump in and
show me if I junked up a
harmony.”
Watching Jordan’s current
practice regime, these traits—strain
and feedback—remain central. To
get up to speed on the wide picking
style he needs for his new tune, he
keeps adjusting the speed of his
practicing to a point just past where
he’s comfortable. When he hits a
wrong note, he immediately stops
and starts over, providing instant
feedback for himself. While
practicing, the strain on his face and
the gasping nature of his breaths
can be uncomfortable even to
watch—I can’t imagine what it feels
like to actually do. But Jordan is
happy to practice like this for hours
at a time.
This, then, explains why Jordan
left me in the dust. I played. But he
practiced. The Nashville studio
musician Mark Casstevens
seconded this dedication to
constantly stretching your abilities.
When I talked to him, for example,
he was in the process of slowly
getting up to speed on a
“complicated new tune in B-flat
with a great deal of barre chords
and nasty counterpoint.” Even
someone with Casstevens’s level of
(literally) award-winning
experience (the Academy of
Country Music recently named him
Specialty Instrumentalist of the
Year) can’t avoid the need to “go
out to the woodshed in order to
practice.”
“I develop muscle memory the
hard way, by repetition,” he said,
echoing Jordan’s long, skill-
stretching practice sessions. “The
harder I work, the more relaxed I
can play, and the better it sounds.”
These observations, of course,
are about more than just guitar
playing. The central idea of this
chapter is that the difference in
strategy that separates average
guitar players like me from stars
like Tice and Casstevens is not
confined to music. This focus on
stretching your ability and receiving
immediate feedback provides the
core of a more universal principle
—one that I increasingly came to
believe provides the key to
successfully acquiring career capital
in almost any field.
How to Become a Grand Master
If you want to understand the
science of how people get good at
something, chess is an excellent
place to start. For one thing, it
provides a clear definition of
ability: your ranking. Though
different chess ranking systems
have been proposed with varying
popularity, the current standard is
the Elo system used by the World
Chess Federation. This system gives
players a score starting at zero that
increases as they get better. Its
calculation is complicated, but at a
high level of approximation it
reflects one’s performance at
official tournaments. If you do
better than expected, it goes up, and
if you do worse, it goes down. A
solid novice player who plays the
occasional weekend competition
will have a score in the triple digits.
Bobby Fischer peaked at 2785. In
1990, Garry Kasparov became the
first player to ever reach 2800. The
highest score ever obtained was
2851, also by Kasparov.
The other reason chess proves
useful for studying performance is
the fact that it’s really hard. To beat
Garry Kasparov in 1997, for
example, IBM’s Deep Blue
supercomputer had to analyze 200
million moves per second, and to
play a competitive opening, it drew
from a database of over 700,000
grand-master games. Given chess’s
difficulty, we can expect that the
strategies required to get good will
be more pronounced and therefore
easier to identify.
These traits explain why
scientists have been studying chess
players since as early as the 1920s,
when a trio of German
psychologists set out to determine if
grand masters had freakish
memories.1 (Interestingly, it turns
out they don’t: Though grand
masters are fantastically efficient at
storing chess positions in their
minds, their general recall ability is
quite average.) One study that
proves especially relevant to our
interests is more recent. In 2005, a
research team led by Neil Charness,
a psychologist from Florida State
University, published the results of
a decades-long investigation of the
practice habits of chess players.2
Throughout the nineties, Charness’s
team had been placing ads in
newspapers and posting flyers at
chess tournaments, looking for
ranked players to participate in their
project. They ended up surveying
over four hundred players, from
around the world, in an effort to
understand why some were better
than others. Each player was given
a form to fill out that requested a
detailed history of the player’s
chess instruction. The respondents
were asked, in essence, to re-create
a time line of their development as
chess players: At what age did they
start? What type of training did they
receive at each year? How many
tournaments did they play? Were
they coached? How much? And so
on.
Previous studies had shown it
takes around ten years, at
minimum, to become a grand
master. (As the psychologist K.
Anders Ericsson likes to point out,
even prodigies like Bobby Fisher
managed to fit in ten years of
playing before they achieved
international recognition: He just
started this accumulation earlier
than most.) This is the “ten-year
rule,” sometimes called the “10,000-
hour rule,” which has been
bouncing around scientific circles
since the 1970s, but was
popularized more recently by
Malcolm Gladwell’s bestselling
2008 book, Outliers.3 Here’s how
he summarized it:
The 10,000-Hour Rule
The idea that excellence at
performing a complex task
requires a critical minimum
level of practice surfaces
again and again in studies of
expertise. In fact, researchers
have settled on what they
believe is the magic number
for true expertise: ten
thousand hours [emphasis
mine].
In Outliers, Gladwell pointed to
this rule as evidence that great
accomplishment is not about natural
talent, but instead about being in the
right place at the right time to
accumulate such a massive amount
of practice. Bill Gates? He happened
to attend one of the first high
schools in the country to install a
computer and allow their students
unsupervised access—making him
one of the first in his generation to
build up thousands of hours of
practice on this technology. Mozart?
His dad was a fanatic about
practicing. By the time Mozart was
being toured around Europe as a
prodigy, he had squeezed in more
than twice the number of practice
hours that similarly aged musician
contemporaries had acquired.
What interests me about
Charness’s study, however, is that it
moves beyond the 10,000-hour rule
by asking not just how long people
worked, but also what type of work
they did. In more detail, they
studied players who had all spent
roughly the same amount of time—
around 10,000 hours—playing
chess. Some of these players had
become grand masters while others
remained at an intermediate level.
Both groups had practiced the same
amount of time, so the difference in
their ability must depend on how
they used these hours. It was these
differences that Charness sought.
In the 1990s, this was a relevant
question. There was debate in the
chess world at the time surrounding
the best strategies for improving.
One camp thought tournament play
was crucial, as it provides practice
with tight time limits and working
through distractions. The other
camp, however, emphasized serious
study—pouring over books and
using teachers to help identify and
then eliminate weaknesses. When
surveyed, the participants in
Charness’s study thought
tournament play was probably the
right answer. The participants, as it
turns out, were wrong. Hours spent
in serious study of the game was
not just the most important factor in
predicting chess skill, it dominated
the other factors. The researchers
discovered that the players who
became grand masters spent five
times more hours dedicated to
serious study than those who
plateaued at an intermediate level.
The grand masters, on average,
dedicated around 5,000 hours out
of their 10,000 to serious study. The
intermediate players, by contrast,
dedicated only around 1,000 to this
activity.
On closer examination, the
importance of serious study
becomes more obvious. In serious
study, Charness concluded,
“materials can be deliberately
chosen or adapted such that the
problems to be solved are at a level
that is appropriately challenging.”
This contrasts with tournament
play, where you are likely to draw
an opponent who is either
demonstrably better or
demonstrably worse than yourself:
both situations where “skill
improvement is likely to be
minimized.” Furthermore, in
serious study, feedback is
immediate: be it from looking up
the answer to a chess problem in a
book or, as is more typically the
case for serious players, receiving
immediate feedback from an expert
coach. The Norwegian chess
phenom Magnus Carlsen, for
example, paid Garry Kasparov over
$700,000 a year to add polish to his
otherwise intuitive playing style.
Notice how well chess fits with
our earlier discussion of guitar
practice. The “serious study”
employed by top chess players
sounds similar to Jordan Tice’s
approach to music: They’re both
focused on difficult activities,
carefully chosen to stretch your
abilities where they most need
stretching and that provide
immediate feedback. At the same
time, notice how chess-tournament
play sounds a lot like my approach
to guitar: It’s enjoyable and
exciting, but it’s not necessarily
making you better. I spent many
hours playing songs I knew,
including dozens and dozens of
hours spent on stage. Like the
intermediate players in the Charness
study, I was letting this satisfying
work pile up ineffectively while
Jordan, during these same ages, was
painstakingly squirreling away the
serious study that would make him
exceptional.
In the early 1990s, Anders
Ericsson, a colleague of Neil
Charness at Florida State
University, coined the term
“deliberate practice” to describe this
style of serious study, defining it
formally as an “activity designed,
typically by a teacher, for the sole
purpose of effectively improving
specific aspects of an individual’s
performance.”4 As hundreds of
follow-up studies have since
shown, deliberate practice provides
the key to excellence in a diverse
array of fields, among which are
chess, medicine, auditing, computer
programming, bridge, physics,
sports, typing, juggling, dance, and
music.5 If you want to understand
the source of professional athletes’
talent, for example, look to their
practice schedules—almost without
exception they have been
systematically stretching their
athletic abilities, with the guidance
of expert coaches, since they were
children. If you instead turned the
tables on Malcolm Gladwell, and
asked him about his writing ability,
he too would point you toward
deliberate practice. In Outliers he
notes that he spent ten years honing
his craft in the Washington Post
newsroom before he moved to the
New Yorker and began writing his
breakout book, The Tipping Point.
“When experts exhibit their
superior performance in public
their behavior looks so effortless
and natural that we are tempted to
attribute it to special talents,”
Ericsson notes. “However, when
scientists began measuring the
experts’ supposedly superior
powers… no general superiority
was found.”6 In other words,
outside a handful of extreme
examples—such as the height of
professional basketball players and
the girth of football linemen—
scientists have failed to find much
evidence of natural abilities
explaining experts’ successes. It is a
lifetime accumulation of deliberate
practice that again and again ends
up explaining excellence.
Here’s what struck me as
important about deliberate practice:
It’s not obvious. Outside of fields
such as chess, music, and
professional athletics, which have
clear competitive structures and
training regimes, few participate in
anything that even remotely
approximates this style of skill
development. As Ericsson explains,
“Most individuals who start as
active professionals… change their
behavior and increase their
performance for a limited time until
they reach an acceptable level.
Beyond this point, however, further
improvements appear to be
unpredictable and the number of
years of work… is a poor predictor
of attained performance.” Put
another way, if you just show up
and work hard, you’ll soon hit a
performance plateau beyond
which you fail to get any better.
This is what happened to me with
my guitar playing, to the chess
players who stuck to tournament
play, and to most knowledge
workers who simply put in the
hours: We all hit plateaus.
When I first encountered the
work of Ericsson and Charness, this
insight startled me. It told me that in
most types of work—that is, work
that doesn’t have a clear training
philosophy—most people are stuck.
This generates an exciting
implication. Let’s assume you’re a
knowledge worker, which is a field
without a clear training philosophy.
If you can figure out how to
integrate deliberate practice into
your own life, you have the
possibility of blowing past your
peers in your value, as you’ll likely
be alone in your dedication to
systematically getting better. That is,
deliberate practice might provide
the key to quickly becoming so
good they can’t ignore you.
To successfully adopt the
craftsman mindset, therefore, we
have to approach our jobs in the
same way that Jordan
approaches his guitar playing or
Garry Kasparov his chess
training—with a dedication to
deliberate practice. How to
accomplish this feat is the goal of
the remainder of this chapter. I
want to start, in the next section, by
arguing that I’m not the first to have
this insight. When we return to the
stories of Alex Berger and Mike
Jackson, we find that deliberate
practice was at the core of their
quest for work they love.
Alex Berger Craves Criticism and
Mike Jackson Doesn’t Check E-
mail
Consider Alex Berger’s two-year
rise from assistant to cocreator of a
national television series. He told
me that getting your writing to
“network quality” can take from a
couple of years at the minimum to
as many as twenty-five. The reason
he was on the fast track, he
explained, was his debate-champ-
style obsession with improving. “I
have a never-ending thirst to get
better,” he said. “It’s like a sport,
you have to practice and you have
to study.” Alex admitted that even
though he’s now an established
writer, he still reads screenwriting
books, looking for places where his
craft could stand improving. “It’s a
constant learning process,” he said.
The other thing I noticed about
Alex is that this learning is not done
in isolation: “You need to be
constantly soliciting feedback from
colleagues and professionals,” he
told me. During his rise, Alex
consistently chose projects where
he’d be forced to show his work to
others. While still working as an
assistant at NBC, for example, he
was writing two pilots: one for VH1
and another with a producer he met
at the National Lampoon. In both
cases, people were waiting to see
his scripts—there was no avoiding
having them be read and dissected.
His Curb Your Enthusiasm spec, to
name another example, which
helped him land his job with
Michael Eisner, underwent a lot of
scrutiny from Alex’s colleagues, at
his request. “When I look back
now, I’m humiliated that I ever
showed it to anyone,” Alex recalled.
But it was necessary if he was going
to get better. “I hope I can look
back ten years later and say the
same about what I’m writing now.”
In Alex, we see exactly the traits
that Anders Ericsson defined as
crucial for deliberate practice. He
stretched his abilities by taking on
projects that were beyond his
current comfort zone; and not just
one at a time, but often up to three
or four writing commissions
concurrently, all the while holding
down a day job! He then
obsessively sought feedback, on
everything—even if, looking back
now, he’s humiliated at the quality
of scripts he was sending out. This
is textbook deliberate practice: And
it worked. It allowed Alex to
acquire career capital in a winner-
take-all market that’s notoriously
reluctant to hand it out.
We see a similar commitment to
deliberate practice in Mike
Jackson’s story. In each stage of his
path to becoming a venture
capitalist he threw himself into a
project beyond his current
capabilities and then hustled to
make it a success. He took on an
ambitious master’s thesis that he
then translated into leading an even
more ambitious international
research project. He went from the
project into the harsh world of
start-ups, where, without outside
investment, his ability to pay his
rent was dependent on him figuring
things out quickly.
Furthermore, at all stages of this
path, Mike was not only stretching
himself, he was also receiving
direct feedback. The work he was
leading for the international
research project was being prepared
for peer review—the epitome of
ruthless response. When running
his start-up, this feedback took the
form of how much money came
through the door. If he ran the
company poorly, there would be no
escaping this fact: His critique
would arrive in the form of
bankruptcy.
In his current position as a
venture capitalist, Mike maintains
his dedication to stretching his
ability, guided by feedback. His
new tool of choice is a spreadsheet,
which he uses to track how he
spends every hour of every day. “At
the beginning of each week I figure
out how much time I want to spend
on different activities,” he
explained. “I then track it so I can
see how close I came to my
targets.” On the sample spreadsheet
he sent me, he divides his activities
into two categories: hard to change
(i.e., weekly commitments he can’t
avoid) and highly changeable (i.e.,
self-directed activities that he
controls). Here’s the amount of time
he dedicates to each:

Mike’s goal with his spreadsheet
is to become more “intentional”
about how his workday unfolds.
“The easiest thing to do is to show
up to work in the morning and just
respond to e-mail the whole day,”
he explained. “But that is not the
most strategic way to spend your
time.” Mike now freely admits that
he doesn’t “do much e-mail.” Even
after we had been working for a
while on the interviews for this
book, my scheduling e-mails to
Mike only sporadically generated a
reply. I eventually figured out that it
worked better to call him while he
was commuting to his Palo Alto
office. On reflection, of course, this
makes perfect sense from Mike’s
perspective. Spending hours every
day sorting through non-critical e-
mail from authors such as myself or
from business students fishing for
tips, among other trivialities, would
impede his ability to raise money
and find good companies—
ultimately the job he’s judged on.
Does he annoy some people
because of this lack of availability?
Probably. But take my example of
eventually being forced to call him
during his commute: The important
stuff still finds its way to him, but
on his schedule.
When you look at Mike’s
spreadsheet, you also notice that he
restricts the hours dedicated to
required tasks that don’t ultimately
make him better at what he does
(eighteen hours). The majority of
his week is instead focused on what
matters: raising money, vetting
investments, and helping his fund’s
companies (twenty-seven hours).
Without this careful tracking, this
ratio would be much different.
This is a great example of
deliberate practice at work. “I want
to spend time on what’s important,
instead of what’s immediate,” Mike
explained. At the end of every week
he prints his numbers to see how
well he achieved this goal, and then
uses this feedback to guide himself
in the week ahead. The fact that
he’s been promoted three times in
less than three years underscores
the effectiveness of this deliberate
approach.
The Five Habits of a Craftsman
The stories of Alex Berger and
Mike Jackson provide a nice
example of deliberate practice in a
knowledge-work setting. It can still
be difficult, however, to figure out
how to apply this strategy in your
own working life. Motivated by this
reality, I drew from the research
literature on deliberate practice, as
well as from the stories of
craftsman like Alex and Mike, to
construct a series of steps for
successfully applying this strategy.
In this section, I’ll detail these steps.
There is no magic formula, but
deliberate practice is a highly
technical process, so I’m hoping
that this specificity will help you get
started.
Step 1: Decide What Capital
Market You’re In
For the sake of clarity, I will
introduce some new terminology.
When you are acquiring career
capital in a field, you can imagine
that you are acquiring this capital in
a specific type of career capital
market. There are two types of
these markets: winner-take-all and
auction. In a winner-take-all
market, there is only one type of
career capital available, and lots of
different people competing for it.
Television writing is a winner-take-
all market because all that matters is
your ability to write good scripts.
That is, the only capital type is your
script-writing capability.
An auction market, by contrast,
is less structured: There are many
different types of career capital, and
each person might generate a
unique collection. The cleantech
space is an auction market. Mike
Jackson’s capital, for example,
included expertise in renewable
energy markets and
entrepreneurship, but there are a
variety of other types of relevant
skills that also could have led to a
job in this field.
With this in mind, the first task
in building a deliberate practice
strategy is to figure out what type of
career capital market you are
competing in. Answering this
question might seem obvious, but
it’s surprisingly easy to get it
wrong. In fact, this is how I
interpret the beginning of Alex’s
story. When he arrived in Los
Angeles, he treated the
entertainment industry as an auction
market. By taking a job as a Web
editor at the National Lampoon, he
began to build up a stable of
college-aged humor writers. He also
filmed a pilot for a low-budget
show for the organization. These
actions make sense in an auction
market where it’s important to build
up a diverse collection of capital.
But the entertainment industry is
not an auction market; it’s instead
winner-take-all. If you want a
career in television writing, as Alex
discovered, only one thing matters:
the quality of your scripts. It took
him a year to realize his mistake,
but once he did, he left the
Lampoon to become an assistant to
a TV executive so he could better
understand the single type of capital
of any value to his field. It was only
at this point that he began to gain
traction in his career.
Mistaking a winner-take-all for
an auction market is common. I see
it often in an area relevant to my
own life: blogging. Here’s a typical
e-mail from among the many I
receive from people asking for
advice on growing their own blog
audience:
“I’ve finished my first month
of posting and am at about
three thousand views. The
bounce rate, however, is
incredibly high, particularly
through Digg and Reddit
submissions, where it can get
close to 90 percent. I’m
wondering what next steps
you think I should take to
bring down the bounce
rate?”
This new blogger was viewing
blogging as an auction market. In
his conception, there are many
different types of capital relevant to
your blog—from its format, to its
post frequency, to its search-engine
optimization, to how easy it is to
find it on social networks (this
particular blogger invested serious
time in submitting every post to as
many social networking sites as
possible). He viewed the world
through statistics and hoped that
with the right combination of
capital he could get them where he
needed them to be to make money.
The problem, however, is that
blogging in the advice space—
where his site existed—is not an
auction market, it’s winner-take-all.
The only capital that matters is
whether or not your posts compel
the reader.
Some top blogs in this space
have notoriously clunky designs,
but they all accomplish the same
baseline goal: They inspire their
readers. When you correctly
understand the market where
blogging exists, you stop calculating
your bounce rate and start focusing
instead on saying something people
really care about—which is where
your energy should be if you want
to succeed.
Mike Jackson, by contrast,
correctly identified that he was in
an auction market. He wasn’t sure
exactly what he wanted to do, but
he knew it would involve the
environment, so he set out to gain
any capital relevant to this broad
topic.
Step 2: Identify Your Capital Type
Once you’ve identified your
market, you must then identify the
specific type of capital to pursue. If
you’re in a winner-take-all market,
this is trivial: By definition, there’s
only one type of capital that
matters. For an auction market,
however, you have flexibility. A
useful heuristic in this situation is to
seek open gates—opportunities to
build capital that are already open
to you. For example, Mike
Jackson’s next step after his degree
was to work with a Stanford
professor on his environmental-
policy research. This decision
helped Mike acquire a key type of
career capital—a nuanced
understanding of international
energy markets. At the same time,
however, keep in mind that this was
also an opportunity that was open
to Mike because he was already a
Stanford student earning a degree in
the field. This made it relatively
easy for him to jump into this new
role. For someone outside of
Stanford, by contrast, being put in
charge of such an important project
would have been a much less likely
proposition.
The advantage of open gates is
that they get you farther faster, in
terms of career capital acquisition,
than starting from scratch. It helps
to think about skill acquisition like
a freight train: Getting it started
requires a huge application of
effort, but changing its track once
it’s moving is easy. In other words,
it’s hard to start from scratch in a
new field. If, for example, Mike
had decided to leave Stanford to go
work for a private sustainability
non-profit, he would have been
starting at the ground floor with no
particular leg up. By instead
leveraging his Stanford education to
gain a position with a Stanford
professor, he was acquiring
valuable capital much sooner.
Step 3: Define “Good”
It’s at this point, once you’ve
identified exactly what skill to
build, that you can, for guidance,
begin to draw from the research on
deliberate practice. The first thing
this literature tells us is that you
need clear goals. If you don’t know
where you’re trying to get to, then
it’s hard to take effective action.
Geoff Colvin, an editor at Fortune
magazine who wrote a book on
deliberate practice,7 put it this way
in an article that appeared in
Fotune: “[Deliberate practice]
requires good goals.”8
When you ask a musician like
Jordan Tice, for example, there’s
little ambiguity about what getting
“good” means to him at that
moment. There’s always some new,
more complicated technique to
master. For Alex Berger, the
definition of “good” was also clear:
his scripts being taken seriously. To
give a concrete example, one of the
projects he was working on while
still an assistant was the
development of a spec script to
submit to talent agencies. For him,
at this early stage of his career
capital acquisition, “good” meant
having a script good enough to land
him an agent. There was no
ambiguity about what it meant to
succeed at this goal.
Step 4: Stretch and Destroy
Returning to Geoff Colvin, in the
article cited above he gives the
following warning about deliberate
practice:
Doing things we know how to
do well is enjoyable, and
that’s exactly the opposite of
what deliberate practice
demands…. Deliberate
practice is above all an effort
of focus and concentration.
That is what makes it
“deliberate,” as distinct from
the mindless playing of scales
or hitting of tennis balls that
most people engage in.
If you show up and do what
you’re told, you will, as Anders
Ericsson explained earlier in this
chapter, reach an “acceptable level”
of ability before plateauing. The
good news about deliberate practice
is that it will push you past this
plateau and into a realm where you
have little competition. The bad
news is that the reason so few
people accomplish this feat is
exactly because of the trait Colvin
warned us about: Deliberate
practice is often the opposite of
enjoyable.
I like the term “stretch” for
describing what deliberate practice
feels like, as it matches my own
experience with the activity. When
I’m learning a new mathematical
technique—a classic case of
deliberate practice—the
uncomfortable sensation in my
head is best approximated as a
physical strain, as if my neurons are
physically re-forming into new
configurations. As any
mathematician will admit, this
stretching feels much different than
applying a technique you’ve already
mastered, which can be quite
enjoyable. But this stretching, as
any mathematician will also admit,
is the precondition to getting better.
This is what you should
experience in your own pursuit of
“good.” If you’re not
uncomfortable, then you’re
probably stuck at an “acceptable
level.”
Pushing past what’s comfortable,
however, is only one part of the
deliberate-practice story; the other
part is embracing honest feedback
—even if it destroys what you
thought was good. As Colvin
explains in his Fortune article,
“You may think that your rehearsal
of a job interview was flawless, but
your opinion isn’t what counts.”
It’s so tempting to just assume what
you’ve done is good enough and
check it off your to-do list, but it’s
in honest, sometimes harsh
feedback that you learn where to
retrain your focus in order to
continue to make progress.
Alex Berger, for example, went
to elaborate lengths to keep a
constant stream of feedback
coming. Recall that during his first
year of seriously pursuing career
capital in television writing, he was
working on two pilots: one for VH1
and another with a producer he met
at the National Lampoon. In both
cases, he was working with
professionals who wouldn’t hesitate
to let him know what was working
and what was not in his writing.
Though he now describes himself
as being somewhat “humiliated” by
the quality of writing he was putting
out for feedback at this stage, he
also recognizes that the continuous
and harsh feedback he received
accelerated the growth of his ability.
Step 5: Be Patient
In his 2007 interview with Charlie
Rose, here’s how Steve Martin
explained his strategy for learning
the banjo: “[I thought], if I stay
with it, then one day I will have
been playing for forty years, and
anyone who sticks with something
for forty years will be pretty good at
it.”
To me, this is a phenomenal
display of patience. Learning
clawhammer banjo is hard, and
because of this, Martin was willing
to look forty years into the future
for the payoff—a recognition of the
frustrating months of hard work
and mediocre playing ahead. In his
memoir, Martin expounds on this
idea when he discusses the
importance of “diligence” for his
success in the entertainment
business. What’s interesting is that
Martin redefines the word so that
it’s less about paying attention to
your main pursuit, and more about
your willingness to ignore other
pursuits that pop up along the way
to distract you. The final step for
applying deliberate practice to your
working life is to adopt this style of
diligence.
The logic works as follows:
Acquiring capital can take time. For
Alex, it took about two years of
serious deliberate practice before
his first television script was
produced. Mike Jackson was a half
decade out of college before
cashing in his capital to land a
dream job.
This is why Martin’s diligence is
so important: Without this patient
willingness to reject shiny new
pursuits, you’ll derail your efforts
before you acquire the capital you
need. I think the image of Martin
returning to his banjo, day after
day, for forty years, is poignant. It
captures well the feel of how career
capital is actually acquired: You
stretch yourself, day after day,
month after month, before finally
looking up and realizing, “Hey, I’ve
become pretty good, and people are
starting to notice.”
Summary of Rule #2
Rule #1 took on the conventional
wisdom about how people end up
loving what they do. It argued that
the passion hypothesis, which says
that the key to loving your work is
to match a job to a pre-existing
passion, is bad advice. There’s little
evidence that most people have pre-
existing passions waiting to be
discovered, and believing that
there’s a magical right job lurking
out there can often lead to chronic
unhappiness and confusion when
the reality of the working world
fails to match this dream.
Rule #2 was the first to tackle the
natural follow-up question: If
“follow your passion” is bad
advice, what should you do
instead? It contended that the traits
that define great work are rare and
valuable. If you want these traits in
your own life, you need rare and
valuable skills to offer in return. I
called these rare and valuable skills
career capital, and noted that the
foundation of constructing work
you love is acquiring a large store
of this capital.
With this in mind, we turned our
attention to this process of capital
acquisition. I argued that it’s
important to adopt the craftsman
mindset, where you focus
relentlessly on what value you’re
offering the world. This stands in
stark contrast to the much more
common passion mindset, which
has you focus only on what value
the world is offering you.
Even with the craftsman mindset,
however, becoming “so good they
can’t ignore you” is not trivial. To
help these efforts I introduced the
well-studied concept of deliberate
practice, an approach to work
where you deliberately stretch your
abilities beyond where you’re
comfortable and then receive
ruthless feedback on your
performance. Musicians, athletes,
and chess players know all about
deliberate practice. Knowledge
workers, however, do not. This is
great news for knowledge workers:
If you can introduce this strategy
into your working life you can vault
past your peers in your acquisition
of career capital.
 RULE #3
Turn Down a Promotion
(Or, the Importance of Control)
Chapter Eight
The Dream-Job Elixir
In which I argue that control over
what you do, and how you do it, is
one of the most powerful traits you
can acquire when creating work
you love.
The Mysterious Red Fire Appeal
When Ryan Voiland graduated
college in 2000 with an Ivy League
diploma in hand, he didn’t follow
his classmates into the big-city
banks or management
consultancies. Instead he did
something unexpected: He bought
farmland. Ryan’s acreage is in
Granby, Massachusetts, a small
town of six thousand in the center
of the state, not far south from
Amherst. The land quality in
Granby is mixed—it’s too far east
from the Connecticut River to
guarantee access to the river
valley’s best soil—but Ryan still
managed to coax a variety of fruits
and vegetables out of his plot. He
called the fledgling concern Red
Fire Farm.
When I arrived in May 2011 to
spend a day at Red Fire, Ryan, who
is now working with his wife,
Sarah, had seventy acres of organic
produce under cultivation. The bulk
of Red Fire’s revenue comes from
their Community Supported
Agriculture (CSA) program, in
which subscribers pay for a share
of the farm’s output at the
beginning of the growing season
and then pick up their produce
every week at distribution stands
throughout the state. In 2011, the
program had around 1,300 CSA
subscribers and had started to turn
people away—there was more
demand than they could meet.
In other words, Red Fire Farm is
a success, but this is not what drew
me to Granby. I arranged to spend a
day with Ryan and Sarah for a
more personal reason: I wanted to
figure out why their lifestyle was so
appealing.
To clarify, I’m not the only one
entranced by Red Fire. This is a
farm with fans. When Ryan and
Sarah arrange special events
throughout the year—a dinner to
celebrate the summer strawberry
harvest, for example, or their fall
pumpkin festival—they quickly sell
out. During my last visit I
overheard a middle-aged woman
tell her friend, “I just love Ryan and
Sarah”—and I’m pretty sure they’d
never actually met. The idea of
Ryan and Sarah, and what their
lifestyle represents, was enough to
draw her to Granby.
This appeal, of course, goes
beyond just Red Fire. The dream of
leaving the rat race to start a farm,
or otherwise live in harmony with
the land, is the perennial fantasy of
the cubicle-bound. In recent years,
the New York Times, for example,
has made great sport of telling the
story of ex-bankers who head off to
Vermont to start farms (stories that
usually end with the banker
slinking home, mud-stained hat in
hand). Something about working
outdoors, sun on your back, no
computer screen in sight, is
undeniably appealing. But why?
This question motivated my visit
to Red Fire. I was unlikely to move
out to the country, but if I could
isolate the underlying traits that
attracted me to this lifestyle, I
reasoned, I could perhaps then
integrate some of these traits into
my own life in the city. In other
words, figuring out this appeal
became a key goal in my quest to
understand how people end up
loving what they do. So I wrote
Ryan and Sarah and asked if I
could spend a day following them
around. Once they agreed, I packed
up my notebook, dusted off my
work boots, and drove due west out
of Boston: I was on a mission to
crack the Red Fire Code.
Cracking the Red Fire Code
Not long into my visit, I joined
Ryan and Sarah for lunch at their
farmhouse. Their kitchen was small
but well-used, packed with
cookbooks and hand-labeled herb
jars. They served bean sandwiches,
open face on local nine-grain bread
and topped with thick-cut cheddar.
As we ate, I asked Ryan how he
ended up becoming a full-time
farmer. I figured that if I wanted to
understand what made his life
appealing today, I needed to first
understand how he got here.
As you encountered in Rule #1
and #2 of this book, by this point in
my quest I had developed an
unconventional theory on how
people end up loving what they do.
I argued in Rule #1 that “follow
your passion” is bad advice, as the
vast majority of people don’t have
pre-existing passions waiting to be
discovered and matched to a job. In
Rule #2, I then countered that
people with compelling careers
instead start by getting good at
something rare and valuable—
building what I called “career
capital”—and then cashing in this
capital for the traits that make great
work great. In this understanding,
finding the right work pales in
importance to working right. As
Ryan told me his story over lunch, I
was gratified to realize that his life
provides a terrific case study of
these ideas in action.
To start, I’ll emphasize that Ryan
did not follow his passion into
farming. Instead, like many people
who end up loving what they do, he
stumbled into his profession, and
then found that his passion for the
work increased along with his
expertise. Ryan grew up in Granby,
but is not from a farming family.
“Growing up, I had little exposure
to professional growing,” he
explained. In middle school, Ryan
was drawn to a universal interest:
making extra spending cash. This
entrepreneurial streak led him to a
series of schemes, from taking on a
paper route to collecting cans for
the local recycling center. His
business breakthrough, however,
came when he started collecting
wild blueberries and selling them
by the carton. “I put up an umbrella
next to the road,” he told me, “and
started my first farm stand.” This,
he discovered, was a good way to
make a buck.
Ryan advanced from wild-
picked berries to selling extra
produce from his parents’ backyard
garden. Looking to increase
revenue, he then talked his parents
into letting him take over their
garden. “My dad was more than
happy with that arrangement,” he
recalls. It was here that Ryan
decided to get serious about career
capital acquisition. “I read
everything about growing that I
could get my hands on… zillions of
different things,” he told me. Soon
he expanded his parents’ garden to
cover most of the backyard,
bringing in compost by the
truckload to increase yield.
By the time Ryan was in high
school he was renting ten acres
from a local farmer and hiring part-
time help during the summer
harvest. He took a loan from the
Massachusetts Farm Services
Agency to finance the purchase of
an old tractor and expanded his
business beyond his farm stand to
also sell at a farmers market and to
a small number of wholesale
clients. After graduating high
school, Ryan headed off to
Cornell’s agriculture college to
further hone his skills with a degree
in fruit and vegetable horticulture—
returning home on the weekends in
order to keep his rented fields
healthy.
Here’s what struck me about
Ryan’s story: He didn’t just decide
one day that he was passionate
about produce and then
courageously head off into the
countryside to start farming.
Instead, by the time he made the
plunge into full-time farming in
2001, when he bought his first land,
he had been painstakingly acquiring
relevant career capital for close to a
decade. This might be less sexy
than the daydream of quitting your
day job one day and then waking
up to the rooster’s crow the next,
but it matches what I consistently
found when researching the
previous two rules: You have to get
good before you can expect good
work.
As lunch concluded, I had
learned the Red Fire history, but I
was still unclear on what exactly
made its presence so appealing. As
we left the kitchen to tour the farm,
however, an insight began to
develop. I noticed that as Ryan
explained his crops, much of his
early wariness fell away. Ryan is
shy. When he talks in front of
crowds, he tends to rush his
sentences to completion, as if
apologetic for interrupting. But
once he got going on his farming
strategies, explaining the difference
between Merrimack sandy loam and
Paxton silt loam, for example, or
his new weeding strategy for the
carrot beds, his shyness gave way
to the enthusiasm of a craftsman
who knows what he’s doing and
has been given the privilege to put
this knowledge to work.
I noticed a similar enthusiasm in
Sarah when she discussed her
efforts to manage the farm’s CSA
program and public image. When
Sarah joined Ryan in Granby in
2007, she was already an advocate
for both organic farming and
community-supported agriculture.
She had studied environmental
policy at Vassar, where she’d
stumbled on the college’s
Poughkeepsie Farm Project CSA.
Inspired, she started her own small-
scale CSA program after
graduating, in nearby Stafford
Springs, Connecticut. Coming to
Red Fire gave Sarah the
opportunity to promote these
beliefs on a larger scale—a
challenge she clearly relishes.
This, I came to realize, is what’s
so appealing about the Red Fire
lifestyle: control. Ryan and Sarah
invested their (extensive) career
capital into gaining control over
what they do and how they do it.
Their working lives aren’t easy—if
I learned anything from my visit to
Red Fire, it’s that farming is a
complicated and stressful pursuit—
but their lives are their own to
direct, and they’re good at this. In
other words, the Red Fire appeal is
not about working outside in the
sun—to farmers, I learned, the
weather is something to battle, not
to enjoy. And it’s not about getting
away from the computer screen—
Ryan spends all winter using Excel
spreadsheets to plan his crop beds,
while Sarah spends a healthy chunk
of each day managing the farm
operations on the office computer.
It is, instead, autonomy that attracts
the Granby groupies: Ryan and
Sarah live a meaningful life on their
own terms.
As I’ll argue next, control isn’t
just the source of Ryan and Sarah’s
appeal, but it turns out to be one of
the most universally important traits
that you can acquire with your
career capital—something so
powerful and so essential to the
quest for work you love that I’ve
taken to calling it the dream-job
elixir.
The Power of Control
Ryan and Sarah have heaps of
control in their working lives, and
this is what makes the Red Fire
lifestyle so appealing. The appeal of
control, however, is not limited to
farmers. Decades of scientific
research have identified this trait as
one of the most important you can
pursue in the quest for a happier,
more successful, and more
meaningful life. Dan Pink’s 2009
bestselling book Drive, for
example, reviews the dizzying array
of different ways that control has
been found to improve people’s
lives.1 As Pink summarizes the
literature, more control leads to
better grades, better sports
performance, better productivity,
and more happiness.
In one such study, mentioned in
Pink’s book, researchers at Cornell
followed over three hundred small
businesses, half of which focused
on giving control to their employees
and half of which did not. The
control-centric businesses grew at
four times the rate of their
counterparts. In another study,
which I found during my own
research, giving autonomy to
middle school teachers in a
struggling school district not only
increased the rate at which the
teachers were promoted, but also,
to the surprise of the researchers,
reversed the downward
performance trend of their
students.2
If you want to observe the power
of control up close in the
workplace, look toward companies
embracing a radical new philosophy
called Results-Only Work
Environment (or, ROWE, for
short). In a ROWE company, all
that matters is your results. When
you show up to work and when
you leave, when you take vacations,
and how often you check e-mail are
all irrelevant. They leave it to the
employee to figure out whatever
works best for getting the important
things done. “No results, no job:
It’s that simple,” as ROWE
supporters like to say.
If you read the business case for
ROWE, available online, you find
example after example of
employees liberated by control.3 At
Best Buy’s corporate headquarters,
for example, the teams that
implemented ROWE saw the rate at
which people left plummet by up to
90 percent. “I love the ROWE
environment…. It makes me feel
like I’m in control of my destiny,”
said one Best Buy employee.
At the Gap’s headquarters,
employees in a ROWE pilot study
found their happiness and
performance improved. “I’ve never
seen my employees happier,” said
one manager. At a non-profit
organization in Redlands, California
—the first non-profit to embrace
ROWE—80 percent of the
employees reported feeling more
engaged while over 90 percent
thought it made their life better:
which is about as close to universal
agreement as is possible in a work
setting. And these are just a few
examples among many.
The more time you spend
reading the research literature, the
more it becomes clear: Giving
people more control over what
they do and how they do it
increases their happiness,
engagement, and sense of
fulfillment. It’s no wonder, then,
that when you flip through your
mental Rolodex of dream jobs,
control is often at the core of their
appeal. Throughout Rule #3, for
example, you’ll meet people in a
variety of different fields who
wielded control to create a working
life they love. Among them is a
freelance computer programmer
who skips work to enjoy sunny
days, a medical resident who took a
two-year leave from his elite
residency program to start a
company, and a famous
entrepreneur who gave away his
millions and sold his possessions to
embrace an unencumbered, globe-
trotting existence. These examples
all have great lives, and as you’ll
learn, they all used control to create
them.
To summarize, if your goal is to
love what you do, your first step is
to acquire career capital. Your next
step is to invest this capital in the
traits that define great work.
Control is one of the most
important targets you can choose
for this investment. Acquiring
control, however, can be
complicated. This is why I’ve
dedicated the remainder of Rule #3
to this goal. In the chapters ahead,
you’ll follow me on my quest to
find out more about this fickle trait.
Chapter Nine
The First Control Trap
In which I introduce the first
control trap, which warns that it’s
dangerous to pursue more control
in your working life before you
have career capital to offer in
exchange.
Jane’s Adventurous Vision
Jane understands the importance of
control. She was a talented student
who earned top-one-percent scores
on her standardized tests and
attended a competitive university,
but she was also unhappy with
following a traditional path from
college and into a steady, well-
paying job. Her vision for her life
was more exotic. As an amateur
athlete who once rode a bike across
the country for charity and
competed in an Ironman triathlon,
she envisioned a more adventurous
future. A copy of the life plan she
sent me includes the goal of
circumnavigating the world’s
oceans and traveling without motor
power across every continent:
“Australia (by unicycle?)…
Antarctica (by dog sled?).” The list
also includes more eccentric goals,
such as surviving in the wilderness
“with no tools or equipment” for
one month, and learning how to
become a fire breather.
To finance this adventurous life,
her plan calls, vaguely, for her to
“build a set of low-maintenance
websites that recurrently earn
enough to support the pursuits on
this list.” Her goal was to get this
revenue up to $3,000 a month,
which she calculated to be enough
to handle her basic expenses.
Eventually, she planned to leverage
these experiences to “develop a
non-profit to develop my vision of
health, human potential, and a life
well-lived.”
At first glance, Jane might
remind you of Ryan and Sarah
from Red Fire Farm. She
recognized that gaining control over
her life trumps simply gaining more
income or prestige. Like Ryan
trading in his diploma for farmland,
this realization gave her the courage
to step off a safe career path and
instead pursue a more compelling
existence. But unlike Ryan and
Sarah, Jane’s plans faltered. Soon
after we met, she revealed that her
embrace of control had led her to
an extreme decision: dropping out
of college. It didn’t take her long to
realize that just because you’re
committed to a certain lifestyle
doesn’t mean you’ll find people
who are committed to supporting
you.
“The current problem is financial
independence,” she told me. “After
quitting college, I started various
businesses, and launched freelance
and blog projects, but lost
motivation to continue before
substantial results came.” One of
these experiments, a blog that she
hoped to become the foundation of
her empire of recurrent revenue
generation, featured only three
posts in nine months.
Jane had discovered a hard truth
of the real world: It’s really hard to
convince people to give you
money. “I agree that it would be
ideal to continue to develop my
vision,” she admitted. “However, I
also need money in order to eat.”
Without even a college degree to
her name, finding this money was
proving difficult. A commitment to
dogsledding across Antarctica, it
turns out, doesn’t read well on a
résumé.
Control Requires Capital
Control is seductive. As I
discovered at Red Fire Farm, this
trait defines the type of dream jobs
that keeps cubicle dwellers up at
night. It was this appeal that
convinced Jane to leave her
comfortable life as a student and
pursue adventure. In doing so,
however, she fell into a trap that
threatens many in their quest for
control:
The First Control Trap
Control that’s acquired
without career capital is not
sustainable.
In Rule #2, I introduced the idea
that career capital is the foundation
for creating work you love. You
must first generate this capital by
becoming good at something rare
and valuable, I argued, then invest
it in the traits that help make great
work great. In the last chapter, I
argued that control is one of the
most valuable traits you can invest
in. Jane recognized the second part
of this argument: Control is
powerful. But she unfortunately
skipped the first part—you need
something valuable to offer in
return for this powerful trait. In
other words, she tried to obtain
control without any capital to offer
in return, and ended up with a mere
shadow of real autonomy. Ryan of
Red Fire Farm, by contrast, avoided
this trap by building up a decade’s
worth of relevant career capital
before taking the dive into full-time
farming.
This trap might sound familiar,
as we saw an example of it earlier
in Rule #2, where I told the story of
Lisa Feuer. As you’ll recall, Feuer
gave up her career in marketing and
advertising to start a yoga business,
even though her only training in
yoga was a monthlong certification
course. Like Jane, she went after
more control without the capital to
back it up. Also like Jane, this path
soon veered in a difficult direction:
Within a year, Feuer was on food
stamps.
The more I studied examples of
control, the more I encountered
people who had made these same
mistakes. Jane’s story, for example,
is just one of many from the
growing lifestyle-design
community. This movement argues
that you don’t have to live life by
other people’s rules. It encourages
its followers to design their own
path through life—preferably one
that’s exciting and enjoyable to live.
It’s easy to find examples of this
philosophy in action, because many
of its disciples blog about their
exploits.
At a high level, of course, there’s
nothing wrong with this
philosophy. The author Timothy
Ferriss, who coined the term
“lifestyle design,” is a fantastic
example of the good things this
approach to life can generate
(Ferriss has more than enough
career capital to back up his
adventurous existence). But if you
spend time browsing the blogs of
lesser-known lifestyle designers,
you’ll begin to notice the same red
flags again and again: A
distressingly large fraction of these
contrarians, like Jane, skipped over
the part where they build a stable
means to support their
unconventional lifestyle. They
assume that generating the courage
to pursue control is what matters,
while everything else is just a detail
that is easily worked out.
One such blogger I found, to
give another example from among
many, quit his job at the age of
twenty-five, explaining, “I was fed
up with living a ‘normal’
conventional life, working 9–5 for
the man [and] having no time and
little money to pursue my true
passions… so I’ve embarked on a
crusade to show you and the rest of
the world how an average Joe…
can build a business from scratch to
support a life devoted to living ‘The
Dream.’ ” The “business” he
referenced, as is the case with many
lifestyle designers, was his blog
about being a lifestyle designer. In
other words, his only product was
his enthusiasm about not having a
“normal” life. It doesn’t take an
economist to point out there’s not
much real value lurking there. Or,
put into our terminology,
enthusiasm alone is not rare and
valuable and is therefore not worth
much in terms of career capital.
This lifestyle designer was investing
in a valuable trait but didn’t have
the means to pay for it.
Not surprisingly, things soon
turned bleak on this fellow’s blog.
After three months of posting
several times a week about how to
fund an unconventional life
through blogging—even though he
wasn’t making any money himself
from his own site—some
frustration crept into his writing. In
one post, he says, with evident
exasperation, “What I noticed is that
[readers] come and go. I’ve put in
the hard yards, writing quality posts
and finding awesome people… but
alas many of [you] just come and
go. This is as annoying as trying to
fill up a bucket with water that has
a bunch of holes in it.” He then
goes on to detail his ten-point plan
for building a more stable audience.
The plan includes steps such as “#2.
Bring the ENERGY” and “#4.
Shower Your Readers with
Appreciation,” but the list still
excludes the most important step of
all: giving readers content they’re
willing to pay for. A few weeks
later, the posts on the blog stopped.
By the time I found it, there hadn’t
been a single new post in over four
months.
This story provides another clear
example of the first control trap: If
you embrace control without
capital, you’re likely to end up like
Jane, Lisa, or our poor frustrated
lifestyle designer—enjoying all the
autonomy you can handle but
unable to afford your next meal.
This first trap, however, turns out
to be only half of the story of why
control can be a tricky trait to
acquire. As I’ll detail in the next
chapter, even after you have the
capital required to acquire real
control, things remain difficult, as
it’s exactly at this point that people
begin to recognize your value and
start pushing back to keep you
entrenched in a less autonomous
path.
Chapter Ten
The Second Control Trap
In which I introduce the second
control trap, which warns that
once you have enough career
capital to acquire more control in
your working life, you have become
valuable enough to your employer
that they will fight your efforts to
gain more autonomy.
Why Lulu Keeps Turning Down
Promotions
Lulu Young is a software developer
and she loves what she does. She
lives in Roslindale, a close-in
suburb of Boston, in a beautifully
renovated duplex. When I met her
there on a rainy spring day in 2011
to talk about work and control, she
needed little prompting before
diving into one of the more detailed
autobiographies I had so far
encountered in my quest. I can tell
you, for example, that she scored a
5 on her AP chemistry test in high
school and that landing her first job
involved a chance encounter with
an old employer at a Bertucci’s in
Wellesley Hills. Here’s what I wrote
in my notes not long into the
interview: “This is someone who
has put a lot of thought into her
career.”
This thoughtfulness evidently
paid off, as Lulu turned out to be
one of the more confident and
contented subjects I have
encountered in my interviews. At
the core of this contentment is
control. Throughout her career,
Lulu repeatedly fought to gain more
freedom in her working life,
sometimes to the shock or dismay
of her employers or friends.
“People tell me that I don’t do
things the way other people do,”
Lulu said. “But I tell them, ‘I’m not
other people.’ ”
She succeeded in these fights, as
you’ll learn, because she was wary
of the first control trap, which was
described in the previous chapter.
That is, she was careful to ensure
she always had enough career
capital to back her up before she
made a bid for more control. This is
a major reason that I want to tell her
story: She provides a great example
of control done right.
Lulu’s first job after graduating
Wellesley College with a
mathematics degree was at the
bottom rung of the software-
development career ladder: She was
working in Quality Assurance
(QA), a fancy term for software
tester.
“So your job would be, for
example, to put text in bold and
then make sure it worked?” I asked
her, as she explained this first job.
“Whoa, whoa, let’s not exaggerate
the amount of responsibility they
gave me!” she joked in response.
This was not a great job. In fact,
this was not even a decent job. It’s
here that Lulu could have easily
fallen into the first control trap:
Finding yourself stuck in a boring
job is exactly the point where
breaking away to pave your own
non-conformist path becomes
tempting. Instead, she decided to
acquire the career capital required
to get somewhere better.
Things played out as follows:
Lulu began hacking the UNIX
operating system that ran the
company’s software. She eventually
taught herself to build scripts that
automated the testing, thus saving
the company time and money. Her
innovations attracted notice, and
after a few short years she was
promoted to senior QA engineer.
By this point, Lulu had built up a
legitimate store of career capital, so
she decided to see what it could buy
her. To regain some autonomy
from a succession of
micromanaging bosses who had
been tormenting her, she demanded
a thirty-hour-a-week schedule so
she could pursue a part-time degree
in philosophy from Tufts. “I would
have asked for less time, but thirty
was the minimum for which you
could still receive full benefits,” she
explained. If Lulu had tried this
during her first year of
employment, her bosses would
have laughed and probably offered
her instead a “zero-hour-a-week
schedule,” but by the time she had
become a senior engineer and was
leading their testing automation
efforts, they really couldn’t say no.
After she earned her degree,
Lulu quit the company and brought
her QA automation skills to a
nearby start-up that had just been
acquired by a major firm. “I had
this spacious office with three
computer screens,” she recalls.
“Every week the office manager
would come by to take our candy
order. You would tell her what
candy you wanted, and it would
show up on your desk…. I had a
lot of fun.”
After several years, the parent
company of the start-up decided to
shut down the Boston-area office,
so Lulu, who had just bought a
house, decided it was time for
something different. When she
reentered the job market, she
generated several offers, including
one to manage the QA group for a
large company. This would have
been a big promotion for Lulu:
more money, more power, and
more prestige; the next step on a
ladder to becoming a hot-shot
executive VP.
Lulu turned it down. Instead, she
took an offer to work with a seven-
person start-up, founded by an old
college friend’s boyfriend, that had
jumped at the chance to acquire
someone with such proven skills. “I
didn’t really understand what they
did, and I’m not sure they had it all
figured out yet either,” she told me.
But this is exactly what made it
appealing to Lulu: tackling
something brand-new, where there
wasn’t a detailed plan in place
already, seemed interesting—a
pursuit where she would have a lot
of say over what she did and how
she did it.
By the time this company was
acquired in 2001, Lulu was the head
software developer. Given this
career capital, when she began to
chafe at the new owner’s
regulations—a dress code, for
example, plus insisting that all
employees work between the hours
of nine and five—she was able to
demand (and receive) three months’
leave. “There will be no way for
you to contact me during this
period,” she told her new bosses.
The leave, it turned out, was also an
excuse to train her staff to work
without her. Soon after her leave
ended, Lulu left and, in a bid for
even more control, became a
freelance software developer. At
this point her skills were so
valuable that finding clients was no
problem. More importantly,
working as a contractor also gave
her extreme flexibility in how she
did her work. She would travel for
three or four weeks at a time when
she felt like getting away. “If the
weather was nice on a Friday,” she
told me, “I would just take the day
off to go flying” (she obtained her
pilot’s license around this time).
When she started work and when
she ended her days were up to her.
“A lot of those days I would take a
niece or nephew and have fun. I
went to the children’s museum and
zoo probably more than anybody
else in the city,” she recalls. “They
couldn’t stop me from doing these
things, as I was just a contractor.”
I interviewed Lulu early on a
weekday afternoon, and the timing
didn’t seem to matter at all. “Hold
on, let me make sure Skype is
turned off so no one can bother
me,” she told me soon after I
arrived. Taking an afternoon off on
a whim to do an interview is not the
type of decision she could have
gotten away with if she had
followed a traditional career path to
become a stock-owning, Porsche-
driving, ulcer-suffering VP. But
then again, stock-owning, Porsche-
driving, ulcer-suffering VPs
probably enjoy their lives quite a bit
less than Lulu.
Control Generates Resistance
Lulu’s story, as I mentioned earlier,
is an example of control done right.
Like Ryan and Sarah of Red Fire
Farms, her career is compelling
because she has infused it with
control over what she does and
how she does it. Also like Ryan and
Sarah, she succeeds in this effort
where others have failed—for
example, Jane from the last chapter
—by always making sure she has
the career capital needed to obtain
this autonomy.
Lurking in this story, however, is
a hidden danger. Though Lulu’s
career was satisfyingly self-directed,
the path to acquiring this freedom
generated conflict. Almost every
time she invested her career capital
to obtain the most control, she also
encountered resistance. When she
leveraged her value to obtain a
thirty-hour schedule at her first job,
for example, her employer couldn’t
say no (she was saving them too
much money), but they didn’t like
it. It took nerve on Lulu’s part to
push through that demand.
Similarly, when she turned down a
major promotion to take an ill-
defined position at a seven-person
start-up, people in her life didn’t
understand.
“You had just bought a house,” I
reminded her. “To turn down a big
important job to go work with an
unknown little company, that’s a
big deal.”
“People thought I was nuts,” she
agreed. Leaving this start-up after it
was acquired was similarly difficult.
Lulu was hesitant to get into details,
but the subtext was that her value
was so high at this company that its
new owners tried every tactic they
could to keep her on board. And
finally, her transition to freelance
work came with its own difficulties.
Her first client really wanted to hire
her full-time to work on the project,
but she refused. “They really didn’t
want a contractor,” she recalls, “but
they didn’t have anyone else who
could do this type of work, so they
eventually had no choice but to
agree.”
The more I met people who
successfully deployed control in
their career, the more I heard
similar tales of resistance from their
employers, friends, and families.
Another example is someone I’ll
call Lewis, who is a resident in a
well-known combined plastic
surgery program, which is arguably
the most competitive medical
residency. Three years into his
residency, he was starting to chafe
under hospital bureaucracy. When I
met him for coffee, he gave me a
vivid example of the frustrations of
life as a modern doctor.
“I once received this patient in
the ER who had his chest cut open
because he had been stabbed in the
heart,” he told me. “I’m on the
gurney, massaging his heart with
my hands as he’s brought into the
operating room. We get to the
room, and obviously this guy needs
a blood transfusion because he has
a hole in his heart.
“ ‘Where’s the blood?’ I ask.
“ ‘We can’t give it to you,’ the
tech replied. ‘You skipped
registration when you came in’—
remember, I literally had this guy’s
heart in my hand when we came
through the door—and I was
thinking, ‘You got to be freaking
kidding me.’ ”
That patient died in the OR. He
probably would still have died even
if he had been given a blood
transfusion, but the point is that this
was exactly the type of autonomy-
demolishing experience that was
eating away at Lewis. He craved
more control in his life, so he did
something unexpected: He took two
years off from his residency
program to start a company that
builds online medical education
tools.
When you ask Lewis why he
wanted to start a company, he
paints a compelling picture. “One
thing a lot of people struggle with
in my field is that they have a lot of
ideas, but don’t know how to get
them turned into reality.” In his
vision, he would become a doctor,
but also be the cofounder of this
company that would continue to
run without requiring his day-to-
day supervision. As he came up
with ideas around medical
education, an interest of his, he
could then hand them over to the
team at the company to be turned
into reality.
“Let’s say I have this idea for a
game that could help premed
students learn some sort of new
concept,” he told me when I asked
for an example. “I could turn to my
team at the company and say, ‘Go
make this happen.’ ” To Lewis,
there’s a great sense of satisfaction
in “creating something that actually
works,” and this company would
provide him that opportunity.
As with Lulu, however, once
Lewis had enough medical expertise
to successfully raise the funding to
begin this company, he had become
valuable enough to his employer
that they didn’t want to let him go.
He was the first person in the ten-
year history of his combined plastic
surgery program to request time off
in the middle of his residency.
“They were asking me, ‘Why would
you do this!?’ ” he recalls. It was
not an easy transition to make.
When I met Lewis, however, his
two-year break was almost up.
During this time, his company had
progressed from an idea into a well-
funded organization with a popular
flagship product (a tool that helps
med students prepare for their
board exams) and a full-time staff
that will keep things rolling as he
returns to finish his residency.
Lewis was clearly happy about his
decision to push for something
different—but it hadn’t been easy.
This is the irony of control.
When no one cares what you do
with your working life, you
probably don’t have enough career
capital to do anything interesting.
But once you do have this capital,
as Lulu and Lewis discovered,
you’ve become valuable enough
that your employer will resist your
efforts. This is what I came to think
of as the second control trap:
The Second Control Trap
The point at which you have
acquired enough career
capital to get meaningful
control over your working life
is exactly the point when
you’ve become valuable
enough to your current
employer that they will try to
prevent you from making the
change.
On reflection, this second trap
makes sense. Acquiring more
control in your working life is
something that benefits you but
likely has no direct benefit to your
employer. Downshifting to a thirty-
hour-per-week schedule, for
example, provided Lulu freedom
from a working environment that
had felt increasingly stifling. But
from the point of view of her
employer, it was simply lost
productivity. In other words, in
most jobs you should expect your
employer to resist your move
toward more control; they have
every incentive to try to convince
you to reinvest your career capital
back into your career at their
company, obtaining more money
and prestige instead of more
control, and this can be a hard
argument to resist.
Courage Revisited
Back in Rule #2, I was dismissive
of the “courage culture.” This was
my term for the growing number of
authors and online commentators
who promote the idea that the only
thing standing between you and a
dream job is building the courage to
step off the expected path. I argued
that it was this courage culture that
led Lisa Feuer to quit her corporate
job to chase an ill-fated yoga
venture. This culture also plays a
big role in egging on the less
successful members of the lifestyle-
design community.
In light of the second control
trap, I need to moderate my
previous disdain. Courage is not
irrelevant to creating work you
love. Lulu and Lewis, as we now
understand, required quite a bit of
courage to ignore the resistance
generated by this trap. The key, it
seems, is to know when the time is
right to become courageous in your
career decisions. Get this timing
right, and a fantastic working life
awaits you, but get it wrong by
tripping the first control trap in a
premature bid for autonomy, and
disaster lurks. The fault of the
courage culture, therefore, is not its
underlying message that courage is
good, but its severe underestimation
of the complexity involved in
deploying this boldness in a useful
way.
Imagine, for example, that you
come up with an idea for injecting
more control into your career. As I
argued earlier, this is an idea worth
paying attention to because control
is so powerful in transforming your
working life that I call it the dream-
job elixir. Also imagine, however,
that as you toy with this idea,
people in your life start offering
resistance. What’s the right thing to
do? The two control traps make this
a hard question to answer.
It’s possible that you don’t have
enough career capital to back up
this bid for more control. That is,
you’re about to fall into the first
control trap. In this case, you
should heed the resistance and
shelve the idea. At the same time,
however, it’s possible that you have
plenty of career capital, and this
resistance is being generated exactly
because you’re so valuable. That is,
you’ve fallen into the second
control trap. In this case, you
should ignore the resistance and
pursue the idea. This, of course, is
the problem with control: Both
scenarios feel the same, but the
right response is different in each.
By this point in my quest, I’ve
encountered enough stories of
control going both right and wrong
to know that this conundrum is
serious—perhaps one of the single
most difficult obstacles facing us in
our quest for work we love. The
cheery slogans of the courage
culture are obviously too crude to
guide us through this tricky
territory. We need a more nuanced
heuristic, something that could
make clear exactly what brand of
control trap you’re facing. As you’ll
learn next, I ended up discovering
this solution in the habits of an
iconoclastic entrepreneur, someone
who has elevated living his life by
his own rules to an art form.
Chapter Eleven
Avoiding the Control Traps
In which I explain the law of
financial viability, which says you
should only pursue a bid for more
control if you have evidence that
it’s something that people are
willing to pay you for.
Derek Sivers Is a Control Freak
Not long into his 2010 TED talk on
creativity and leadership, Derek
Sivers plays a video clip of a crowd
at an outdoor concert. A young man
without a shirt starts dancing by
himself. The audience members
seated nearby look on curiously.
“A leader needs the guts to stand
alone and look ridiculous,” Derek
says. Soon, however, a second
young man joins the first and starts
dancing.
“Now comes the first follower
with a crucial role… the first
follower transforms the lone nut
into a leader.” As the video
continues, a few more dancers join
the group. Then several more.
Around the two-minute mark, the
dancers have grown into a crowd.
“And ladies and gentlemen,
that’s how a movement is made.”1
The TED audience gives Derek a
standing ovation. He bows, then
does a little dance himself on stage.
No one can accuse Derek Sivers
of being a conformist. During his
career, he has repeatedly played the
role of the first dancer. He starts
with a risky move, designed to
maximize his control over what he
does and how he does it. By doing
so, he’s at risk of looking like the
“lone nut” dancing alone.
Throughout Derek’s career,
however, there always ended up
being a second dancer who
validated his decision, and then
eventually a crowd arrived,
defining the move as successful.
His first risky move occurred in
1992 when he quit a good job at
Warner Bros. to pursue music full-
time. He played guitar and toured
with the Japanese musician and
producer Ryuichi Sakamoto, and by
all accounts was pretty good at it.
His next big move was in 1997,
when he started CD Baby, a
company that helped independent
artists sell their CDs online. In an
age before iTunes, this company
filled a crucial need for independent
musicians, and the company grew.
In 2008, he sold it to Disc Makers
for $22 million.
At this point in his career,
conventional wisdom dictated that
Derek should move to a large house
outside of San Francisco and
become an angel investor. But
Derek was never interested in
conventional wisdom. Instead, he
put all of the proceeds from the sale
into a charitable trust to support
music education, living off the
smallest possible amount of interest
allowed by law. He then sold his
possessions and began traveling the
world in search of an interesting
place to live. When I spoke with
him, he was in Singapore. “I love
that the country has so little gravity,
it doesn’t try to hold you here, it’s
instead a base from which you can
go explore,” he said. When I asked
him why he’s living overseas, he
replied, “I follow a rule with my life
that if something is scary, do it. I’ve
lived everywhere in America, and
for me, a big scary thing was living
outside the country.”
After taking time off to read,
learn Mandarin, and travel the
world, Derek has recently turned
his sights on a new company:
MuckWork. This service allows
musicians to outsource boring tasks
so they can spend more time on the
creative things that matter. He
started the company because he
thought the idea sounded fun.
Here’s what interests me about
Derek: He loves control. His whole
career has been about making big
moves, often in the face of
resistance, to gain more control
over what he does and how he does
it. And not only does he love
control, but he’s fantastically
successful at achieving it. This is
why I got him on the phone from
Singapore: I wanted to find out how
he achieved this feat. In more
detail, I asked what criteria he uses
to decide which projects to pursue
and which to abandon—in essence,
I wanted his map for navigating the
control traps described in the last
two chapters.
Fortunately for us, he had a
simple but surprisingly effective
answer to my question….
The Law of Financial Viability
When I explained what I was after,
Derek got it right away.
“You mean, the type of mental
algorithm that prevents the lawyer,
who has had this successful career
for twenty years, from suddenly
saying, ‘You know, I love
massages, I’m going to become a
masseuse’?” he asked.
“That’s it,” I replied.
Derek thought for a moment.
“I have this principle about
money that overrides my other life
rules,” he said. “Do what people
are willing to pay for.”
Derek made it clear that this is
different from pursuing money for
the sake of having money.
Remember, this is someone who
gave away $22 million and sold his
possessions after his company was
acquired. Instead, as he explained:
“Money is a neutral indicator of
value. By aiming to make money,
you’re aiming to be valuable.”
He also emphasized that hobbies
are clearly exempt from this rule.
“If I want to learn to scuba dive, for
example, because I think it’s fun,
and people won’t pay me to do that,
I don’t care, I’m going to do it
anyway,” he said. But when it
comes to decisions affecting your
core career, money remains an
effective judge of value. “If you’re
struggling to raise money for an
idea, or are thinking that you will
support your idea with unrelated
work, then you need to rethink the
idea.”
At first encounter, Derek’s
career, which orbits around creative
pursuits, might seem divorced from
matters as prosaic and crass as
money. But when he renarrated his
path from the perspective of this
mental algorithm, it suddenly made
more sense.
His first big move, for example,
was to become a professional
musician in 1992. As Derek
explained to me, he started by
pursuing music at night and on the
weekend. “I didn’t quit my day job
until I was making more money
with my music.”
His second big move was to start
CD Baby. Again, he didn’t turn his
attention full-time to this pursuit
until after he had built up a
profitable client base. “People ask
me how I funded my business,” he
said. “I tell them first I sold one
CD, which gave me enough money
to sell two.” It grew from there.
In hindsight, Derek’s bids for
control remain big and non-
conformist, but given his mental
algorithm on only doing what
people are paying for, they now
also seem much less risky. This
idea is powerful enough that I
should give it its own official-
sounding title:
The Law of Financial
Viability
When deciding whether to
follow an appealing pursuit
that will introduce more
control into your work life,
seek evidence of whether
people are willing to pay for
it. If you find this evidence,
continue. If not, move on.
When I began reflecting on this
law, I saw that it applied again and
again to examples of people
successfully acquiring more control
in their careers. To understand this,
notice that the definition of “willing
to pay” varies. In some cases, it
literally means customers paying
you money for a product or a
service. But it can also mean getting
approved for a loan, receiving an
outside investment, or, more
commonly, convincing an employer
to either hire you or keep writing
you paychecks. Once you adopt this
flexible definition of “pay for it,”
this law starts popping up all over.
Consider, for example, Ryan
Voiland from Red Fire Farm. Many
well-educated city dwellers, fed up
with urban chaos, buy some
farmland and try to make a living
working with their hands. Most fail.
What makes Ryan different is that
he made sure people were willing to
pay him to farm before he tried it.
In more detail, because he wasn’t a
rich ex-banker, buying his first
property required a loan from the
Massachusetts Farm Services
Agency—and the FSA does not
give away its money easily. You
have to submit a detailed business
plan that convinces them that you’ll
actually make money with your
farm. With ten years of experience
on his side, Ryan was able to make
this argument.
Lulu provides another good
example of this law in action. Here,
the definition of “willing to pay”
concerned her paycheck. She
judged her moves toward more
autonomy by whether or not
someone would hire her or keep
paying her while she made them.
Her first big move, for example,
was to drop to a thirty-hour-per-
week schedule. She knew she had
enough capital to support this
change because her employer said
yes. In later jobs, when she
negotiated a three-month leave or
insisted on working freelance with
an open schedule, these were also
bids for more control that were
validated by the fact that her
employers accepted them. If she
had had less career capital they
would have had no problem telling
her good-bye.
On the flip side, when you look
at stories of people who were
unsuccessful in adding more
control to their careers, you often
find that this law has been ignored.
Remember Jane from earlier in
Rule #3: She dropped out of college
with the vague idea that some sort
of online business would support a
lifestyle of adventure. If she had
met Derek Sivers, she would have
delayed this move until she had real
evidence that she could make
money online. In this case, the law
would have served its purpose well,
as a simple experiment would have
likely revealed that passive-income
websites are more myth than reality,
and thus prevented her rash
abandonment of her education.
This doesn’t mean that Jane would
have had to resign herself to a life
of boring work. On the contrary,
the law could have provided her
structure to keep exploring
variations on her adventurous life
vision until she could find one to
pursue that would actually yield
results.
Summary of Rule #3
Rules #1 and #2 laid the
foundation for my new thinking on
how people end up loving what
they do. Rule #1 dismissed the
passion hypothesis, which says
that you have to first figure out
your true calling and then find a job
to match. Rule #2 replaced this idea
with career capital theory, which
argues that the traits that define
great work are rare and valuable,
and if you want these in your
working life, you must first build
up rare and valuable skills to offer
in return. I call these skills “career
capital,” and in Rule #2 I dived into
the details of how to acquire it.
The obvious next question is
how to invest this capital once you
have it. Rule #3 explored one
answer to this question by arguing
that gaining control over what you
do and how you do it is incredibly
important. This trait shows up so
often in the lives of people who
love what they do that I’ve taken to
calling it the dream-job elixir.
Investing your capital in control,
however, turns out to be tricky.
There are two traps that commonly
snare people in their pursuit of this
trait. The first control trap notes
that it’s dangerous to try to gain
more control without enough
capital to back it up.
The second control trap notes
that once you have the capital to
back up a bid for more control,
you’re still not out of the woods.
This capital makes you valuable
enough to your employer that they
will likely now fight to keep you on
a more traditional path. They realize
that gaining more control is good
for you but not for their bottom
line.
The control traps put you in a
difficult situation. Let’s say you
have an idea for pursuing more
control in your career and you’re
encountering resistance. How can
you tell if this resistance is useful
(for example, it’s helping you avoid
the first control trap) or something
to ignore (for example, it’s the
result of the second control trap)?
To help navigate this control
conundrum, I turned to Derek
Sivers. Derek is a successful
entrepreneur who has lived a life
dedicated to control. I asked him
his advice for sifting through
potential control-boosting pursuits
and he responded with a simple
rule: “Do what people are willing to
pay for.” This isn’t about making
money (Derek, for example, is
more or less indifferent to money,
having given away to charity the
millions he made from selling his
first company). Instead, it’s about
using money as a “neutral indicator
of value”—a way of determining
whether or not you have enough
career capital to succeed with a
pursuit. I called this the law of
financial viability, and concluded
that it’s a critical tool for navigating
your own acquisition of control.
This holds whether you are
pondering an entrepreneurial
venture or a new role within an
established company. Unless people
are willing to pay you, it’s not an
idea you’re ready to go after.
 RULE #4
Think Small, Act Big
(Or, the Importance of Mission)
Chapter Twelve
The Meaningful Life of Pardis
Sabeti
In which I argue that a unifying
mission to your working life can be
a source of great satisfaction.
The Happy Professor
Harvard’s state-of-the-art Northwest
Science Building is found at 52
Oxford Street in Cambridge,
Massachusetts, a ten-minute walk
from the tourists packing the
university’s famed central yard. It’s
part of a complex of hulking brick-
and-glass laboratories that form the
new heart of Harvard’s fabled
research engine. Inside, the
Northwest looks like a Hollywood
vision of a science lab. The
hallways defining the perimeter of
each floor are polished concrete
and lit dimly in the style of
television crime procedurals.
Inside the hallways, in the center
of the building, are the wetlabs,
with graduate students manipulating
pipettes visible through windowed
steel doors. On the other side of the
hallway are the professors’ offices,
defined by floor-to-ceiling glass
partitions. It was one of these
offices in particular that drew me to
the Northwest on a sunny June
afternoon—the office of Pardis
Sabeti, a thirty-five-year-old
professor of evolutionary biology
who had mastered one of the more
elusive but powerful strategies in
the quest for work you love.
One of the first things you’ll
notice if you spend time around
Pardis is that she enjoys her life.
Biology, like any high-stakes
academic field, is demanding.
Because of this it has a reputation
for turning young professors into
curmudgeons who adopt a
masochistic brand of workaholism,
in which relaxation becomes a sign
of failure and the accomplishments
of peers become tragedies. This can
be a bleak existence. Pardis, for her
part, has avoided this fate.
Not five minutes into my visit,
for example, a young grad student,
one of ten people Pardis employs in
her eponymous Sabeti Lab, pokes
his head into the office.
“We’re heading down to
volleyball practice,” he says,
referencing the lab’s team, which
evidently takes itself seriously. She
promises to join them as soon as
our interview ends.
Volleyball is not Pardis’s only
hobby. In a corner of her office she
keeps an acoustic guitar that serves
as more than decoration: Pardis
plays in a band called Thousand
Days, which is well known in
Boston music circles. In 2008, PBS
featured the band in a Nova special
called Researchers Who Rock.
Pardis’s energy for these
activities is a side effect of her
enthusiasm for her work. The bulk
of her research focuses on Africa,
with studies ongoing in Senegal,
Sierra Leone, and most of all,
Nigeria. To Pardis, this work is
about more than just the
accumulation of publications and
grant money. At one point in our
conversation, for example, she pulls
out her laptop: “You have to see
this video of me and my girls,” she
says, loading up a YouTube clip of
Pardis, guitar in hand, leading a
group of four African women in a
song. The video was shot outdoors
in Nigeria. Palm trees provide the
backdrop. The women, I learn,
work in a clinic supported by the
Sabeti Lab. “These women deal
with people who die in devastating
ways every day,” she says to no one
in particular while the video plays.
On screen, everyone is smiling
while Pardis leads them, with mixed
success, through the verses. “I love
going there,” she adds. “Nigeria is
my African home.”
It’s clear that Pardis has avoided
the grinding cynicism that traps so
many young academics, and has
instead built an engaging life (“It’s
not always easy,” she once said in
an interview, “but I truly love what
I do”1). But how did she pull off
this feat? As I spent time with
Pardis, I recognized that her
happiness comes from the fact
that she built her career on a
clear and compelling mission
—something that not only gives
meaning to her work but provides
the energy needed to embrace life
beyond the lab. In the
overachieving style typical of
Harvard, Pardis’s mission is by no
means subtle: Her goal, put simply,
is to rid the world of its most
ancient and deadly diseases.
Pardis’s Mission
As a graduate student, Pardis
stumbled into the emerging field of
computational genetics—the use of
computers to help understand DNA
sequences. She developed an
algorithm that sifts through
databases of human genetic
information looking for traces of an
elusive target: ongoing human
evolution. To the general public,
the idea that humans are still
evolving can be surprising, but
among evolutionary biologists it’s
taken for granted. (One of the
classic examples of recent human
evolution is lactose tolerance—the
ability to digest milk into adulthood
—a trait that didn’t start spreading
through the human population until
we domesticated milk-producing
animals.)
Pardis’s algorithm uses statistical
techniques to hunt down patterns of
gene migration that match what you
would expect from selective
pressure—for example, a mutation
that popped up recently in human
development but has since spread
quickly among a population. The
algorithm, in other words, searches
blindly, turning up “candidate”
genes that look like they’re the
result of natural selection, but
leaving it up to the researcher to
figure out why natural selection
deemed the gene useful.
Pardis uses the algorithm to
search for recently evolved genes
that provide disease resistance. Her
logic is that if she can find these
genes and understand how they
work, biomedical researchers might
be able to mimic their benefit in a
treatment. It makes sense, of
course, that disease-resistance genes
would be among the candidates
turned up by Pardis’s algorithm, as
they provide a classic example of
natural selection in action. If a
deadly virus has been killing off
humans in a population for a long
time, biologists would say that this
population is under “selective
pressure.” If a lucky few members
of the group then happen to evolve
a resistance to the disease, this
pressure ensures that the new gene
will spread quickly (people with the
new gene die less frequently than
those without it). This rapid spread
of a new gene is exactly the type of
signature Pardis’s algorithm has
been tuned to detect.
Pardis’s first big discovery was a
gene that provides resistance to
Lhassa fever, one of the oldest and
most deadly diseases of the African
continent, responsible for tens of
thousands of deaths each year.
(“People don’t just die with this
disease,” she emphasized, “they die
extreme deaths.”) She has since
added malaria and the bubonic
plague to the list of “ancient
scourges” that she’s tackling with
her computational strategy.
Pardis’s career is driven by a
clear mission: to use new
technology to fight old diseases.
This research is clearly important—
an observation emphasized by the
fact that she’s received seven-figure
grants for her work from both the
Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
and the NIH. Later in this book,
we’ll dive into the details of how
she found this focus, but what’s
important to note now is that her
mission provides her a sense of
purpose and energy, traits that have
helped her avoid becoming a
cynical academic and instead
embrace her work with enthusiasm.
Her mission is the foundation on
which she builds love for what she
does, and therefore it’s a career
strategy we need to better
understand.
The Power of Mission
To have a mission is to have a
unifying focus for your career. It’s
more general than a specific job and
can span multiple positions. It
provides an answer to the question,
What should I do with my life?
Missions are powerful because they
focus your energy toward a useful
goal, and this in turn maximizes
your impact on your world—a
crucial factor in loving what you
do. People who feel like their
careers truly matter are more
satisfied with their working lives,
and they’re also more resistant to
the strain of hard work. Staying up
late to save your corporate litigation
client a few extra million dollars
can be draining, but staying up late
to help cure an ancient disease can
leave you more energized than
when you started—perhaps even
providing the extra enthusiasm
needed to start a lab volleyball team
or tour with a rock band.
I was drawn to Pardis Sabeti
because her career is driven by a
mission and she’s reaped happiness
in return. After meeting her, I went
searching for other people who
leveraged this trait to create work
they love. This search led me to a
young archaeologist whose mission
to popularize his field led to his
own television series on the
Discovery Channel, and to a bored
programmer who systematically
studied marketing to devise a
mission that injected excitement
back into his working life. In all
three cases, I tried to decode exactly
how these individuals found and
then successfully deployed their
missions. In short, I wanted an
answer to an important question:
How do you make mission a reality
in your working life?
The answers I found are
complicated. To better understand
this complexity, let’s put the topic
back into the broader context of the
book. In the preceding rules, I have
argued that “follow your passion” is
bad advice, as most people aren’t
born with pre-existing passions
waiting to be discovered. If your
goal is to love what you do, you
must first build up “career capital”
by mastering rare and valuable
skills, and then cash in this capital
for the traits that define great work.
As I’ll explain, mission is one of
these desirable traits, and like any
such desirable trait, it too requires
that you first build career capital—a
mission launched without this
expertise is likely doomed to sputter
and die.
But capital alone is not enough to
make a mission a reality. Plenty of
people are good at what they do but
haven’t reoriented their career in a
compelling direction. Accordingly,
I will go on to explore a pair of
advanced tactics that also play an
important role in making the leap
from a good idea for a mission to
actually making that mission a
reality. In the chapters ahead, you’ll
learn the value of systematically
experimenting with different proto-
missions to seek out a direction
worth pursuing. You’ll also learn
the necessity of deploying a
marketing mindset in the search for
your focus. In other words,
missions are a powerful trait to
introduce into your working life,
but they’re also fickle, requiring
careful coaxing to make them a
reality.
This subtlety probably explains
why so many people lack an
organizing focus to their careers,
even though such focus is widely
admired: Missions are hard. By this
point in my quest, however, I had
become comfortable with “hard,”
and I hope that if you’ve made it
this far in the book, you have
gained this comfort as well.
Hardness scares off the
daydreamers and the timid, leaving
more opportunity for those like us
who are willing to take the time to
carefully work out the best path
forward and then confidently take
action.
Chapter Thirteen
Missions Require Capital
In which I argue that a mission
chosen before you have relevant
career capital is not likely to be
sustainable.
Mission Failure
When Sarah wrote me, she was
stuck. She had recently quit her job
as a newspaper editor to attend
graduate school to study cognitive
science. Sarah had considered grad
school right out of college, but at
the time, she worried that she didn’t
have the right skills. With age,
however, came more confidence,
and after she signed up for and then
aced an artificial-intelligence course
that would have “scared a younger
version of myself,” Sarah decided
to take the plunge and become a
full-time doctoral candidate.
Then the trouble started. Not
long into her new student career
Sarah became paralyzed by her
work’s lack of an organizing
mission. “I feel I have too many
interests,” she told me. “I can’t
decide if I want to do theoretical
work or something more applied,
or which would be more useful.
Even more threatening, I believe all
the other researchers to be
geniuses…. What would you do if
you were in my shoes?”
Sarah’s story reminded me of
Jane, whom I introduced in Rule
#3. As you might recall, Jane
dropped out of college to “[start] a
non-profit to develop my vision of
health, human potential, and a life
well-lived.” This mission,
unfortunately, ran into a harsh
financial reality when Jane failed to
raise money to support her vague
vision. When I met her, she was
soliciting advice about finding a
normal job, a task that was proving
difficult because she lacked a
degree.
Both Sarah and Jane recognized
the power of mission, but struggled
to deploy the trait in their own
working lives. Sarah desperately
wanted a Pardis Sabeti style of life-
transforming research focus, yet her
failure to immediately identify such
a focus led her to rethink graduate
school. Jane, on the other hand,
slapped together something vague
(a non-profit that would “develop
my vision of… a life well-lived”)
and then hoped the details would
work themselves out once she got
started. Jane fared no better than
Sarah: The details, it turned out, did
not work themselves out, leaving
Jane penniless and still without a
college degree.
I tell these stories because they
emphasize an important point:
Missions are tricky. As Sarah and
Jane learned, just because you
really want to organize your work
around a mission doesn’t mean that
you can easily make it happen.
After my visit to Harvard, I realized
that if I was going to deploy this
trait in my own career, I needed to
better understand this trickiness.
That is, I needed to figure out what
Pardis did differently than Sarah
and Jane. The answer I eventually
found came from an unexpected
place: the attempts to explain a
puzzling phenomenon.
The Baffling Popularity of
Randomized Linear Network
Coding
As I write this chapter, I’m
attending a computer science
conference in San Jose, California.
Earlier today, something interesting
happened. I attended a session in
which four different professors
from four different universities
presented their latest research.
Surprisingly, all four presentations
tackled the same narrow problem
—information dissemination in
networks—using the same narrow
technique—randomized linear
network coding. It was as if my
research community woke up one
morning and collectively and
spontaneously decided to tackle the
same esoteric problem.
This example of joint discovery
surprised me, but it would not have
surprised the science writer Steven
Johnson. In his engaging 2010
book, Where Good Ideas Come
From, Johnson explains that such
“multiples” are frequent in the
history of science.1 Consider the
discovery of sunspots in 1611: As
Johnson notes, four scientists, from
four different countries, all
identified the phenomenon during
that same year. The first electrical
battery? Invented twice in the mid-
eighteenth century. Oxygen?
Isolated independently in 1772 and
1774. In one study cited by
Johnson, researchers from
Columbia University found just shy
of 150 different examples of
prominent scientific breakthroughs
made by multiple researchers at
near the same time.
These examples of simultaneous
discovery, though interesting, might
seem tangential to our interest in
career mission. I ask, however, that
you stick with me, as the
explanation for this phenomenon is
the first link in a chain of logic that
helped me decode what Pardis did
differently than Sarah and Jane.
Big ideas, Johnson explained, are
almost always discovered in the
“adjacent possible,” a term
borrowed from the complex-system
biologist Stuart Kauffman, who
used it to describe the spontaneous
formation of complex chemical
structures from simpler structures.
Given a soup of chemical
components sloshing and mixing
together, noted Kauffman, lots of
new chemicals will form. Not every
new chemical, however, is equally
likely. The new chemicals you’ll
find are those that can be made by
combining the structures already in
the soup. That is, the new chemicals
are in the space of the adjacent
possible defined by the current
structures.
When Johnson adopted the term,
he shifted it from complex
chemicals to cultural and scientific
innovations. “We take the ideas
we’ve inherited or that we’ve
stumbled across, and we jigger
them together into some new
shape,” he explained. The next big
ideas in any field are found right
beyond the current cutting edge, in
the adjacent space that contains the
possible new combinations of
existing ideas. The reason important
discoveries often happen multiple
times, therefore, is that they only
become possible once they enter the
adjacent possible, at which point
anyone surveying this space—that
is, those who are the current cutting
edge—will notice the same
innovations waiting to happen.
The isolation of oxygen as a
component of air, to name one of
Johnson’s examples of a multiple
discovery, wasn’t possible until two
things happened: First, scientists
began to think about air as a
substance containing elements, not
just a void; and second, sensitive
scales, a key tool in the needed
experiments, became available.
Once these two developments
occurred, the isolation of oxygen
became a big fat target in the newly
defined adjacent possible—visible
to anyone who happened to be
looking in that direction. Two
scientists—Carl Wilhelm Scheele
and Joseph Priestley—were looking
in this direction, and therefore both
went on to conduct the necessary
experiments independently but at
nearly the same time.
The adjacent possible also
explains my earlier example of four
researchers tackling the same
obscure problem with the same
obscure technique at the conference
I attended. The specific technique
applied in this case—a technique
called randomized linear network
coding—came to the attention of
the computer scientists I work with
only over the last two years, as
researchers who study a related
topic began to apply it successfully
to thorny problems. The scientists
who ended up presenting papers on
this technique at my conference had
all noticed its potential around the
same time. Put in Johnson’s terms,
this technique redefined the cutting
edge in my corner of the academic
world, and therefore it also
redefined the adjacent possible, and
in this new configuration the
information dissemination problem,
like the discovery of oxygen many
centuries earlier, suddenly loomed
as a big target waiting to be tackled.
We like to think of innovation as
striking us in a stunning eureka
moment, where you all at once
change the way people see the
world, leaping far ahead of our
current understanding. I’m arguing
that in reality, innovation is more
systematic. We grind away to
expand the cutting edge, opening up
new problems in the adjacent
possible to tackle and therefore
expand the cutting edge some more,
opening up more new problems,
and so on. “The truth,” Johnson
explains, “is that technological (and
scientific) advances rarely break out
of the adjacent possible.”
As I mentioned, understanding
the adjacent possible and its role in
innovation is the first link in a chain
of argument that explains how to
identify a good career mission. In
the next section, I’ll forge the
second link, which connects the
world of scientific breakthroughs to
the world of work.
The Capital-Driven Mission
Scientific breakthroughs, as we just
learned, require that you first get to
the cutting edge of your field. Only
then can you see the adjacent
possible beyond, the space where
innovative ideas are almost always
discovered. Here’s the leap I made
as I pondered Pardis Sabeti around
the same time I was pondering
Johnson’s theory of innovation: A
good career mission is similar to a
scientific breakthrough—it’s an
innovation waiting to be
discovered in the adjacent
possible of your field. If you want
to identify a mission for your
working life, therefore, you must
first get to the cutting edge—the
only place where these missions
become visible.
This insight explains Sarah’s
struggles: She was trying to find a
mission before she got to the cutting
edge (she was still in her first two
years as a graduate student when
she began to panic about her lack of
focus). From her vantage point as a
new graduate student, she was
much too far from the cutting edge
to have any hope of surveying the
adjacent possible, and if she can’t
see the adjacent possible, she’s not
likely to identify a compelling new
direction for her work. According
to Johnson’s theory, Sarah would
have been better served by first
mastering a promising niche—a
task that may take years—and only
then turning her attention to seeking
a mission.
This distance from the adjacent
possible also tripped up Jane. She
wanted to start a transformative
non-profit that changed the way
people live their lives. A successful
non-profit, however, needs a
specific philosophy with strong
evidence for its effectiveness. Jane
didn’t have such a philosophy. To
find one, she would have needed a
nice view of the adjacent possible
in her corner of the non-profit
sector, and this would have
required that she first get to the
cutting edge of efforts to better
people’s lives—a process that, as
with Sarah, requires patience and
perhaps years of work. Jane was
trying to identify a mission before
she got to the cutting edge and she
predictably didn’t come up with
anything that could turn people’s
heads.
In hindsight, these observations
are obvious. If life-transforming
missions could be found with just a
little navel-gazing and an optimistic
attitude, changing the world would
be commonplace. But it’s not
commonplace; it’s instead quite
rare. This rareness, we now
understand, is because these
breakthroughs require that you first
get to the cutting edge, and this is
hard—the type of hardness that
most of us try to avoid in our
working lives.
The alert reader will notice that
this talk of “getting to the cutting
edge” echoes the idea of career
capital, which was introduced back
in Rule #2. As you’ll recall, career
capital is my term for rare and
valuable skills. It is, I argued, your
main bargaining chip in creating
work you love: Most people who
love their work got where they are
by first building up career capital
and then cashing it in for the types
of traits that define great work.
Getting to the cutting edge of a field
can be understood in these terms:
This process builds up rare and
valuable skills and therefore builds
up your store of career capital.
Similarly, identifying a compelling
mission once you get to the cutting
edge can be seen as investing your
career capital to acquire a desirable
trait in your career. In other words,
mission is yet another example of
career capital theory in action. If
you want a mission, you need to
first acquire capital. If you skip this
step, you might end up like Sarah
and Jane: with lots of enthusiasm
but very little to show for it.
Not surprisingly, when we return
to the story of Pardis Sabeti, we
find that her path to a mission
provides a nice example of this
career capital perspective translated
into practice.
Pardis’s Patience
“I think you do need passion to be
happy,” Pardis Sabeti told me. At
first this sounds like she’s
supporting the passion hypothesis
that I debunked in Rule #1. But
then she elaborated: “It’s just that
we don’t know what that passion is.
If you ask someone, they’ll tell you
what they think they’re passionate
about, but they probably have it
wrong.” In other words, she
believes that having passion for
your work is vital, but she also
believes that it’s a fool’s errand to
try to figure out in advance what
work will lead to this passion.
When you hear Pardis’s story,
the origin of this philosophy
becomes clear. “In high school, I
was obsessed with math,” she told
me. Then she had a biology teacher
whom she loved, which made her
think that biology might be for her.
When she arrived at MIT, she was
forced to choose between math and
bio. “It turns out that the MIT bio
department has an unbelievable
emphasis on teaching,” she
explained. “So I majored in bio.”
With a bio major came a new plan:
She decided she was destined to
become a doctor. “I perceived
myself as someone who cared
about people. I wanted to practice
medicine.”
Pardis did very well at MIT, won
a Rhodes Scholarship, and used it
to go earn her PhD at Oxford. She
focused on biological anthropology,
a typically archaic Oxfordian name
for a field most would simply call
genetics.
It was at Oxford that Pardis
decided that Africa and infectious
diseases were also a potentially
interesting topic to study. If you’re
keeping count, this was the third
field that at some point in her
student career attracted her—the
full list now contains math,
medicine, and infectious disease.
This is why she’s wary of the
strategy of trying to identify your
one true calling in advance—in her
experience, lots of different things
can, at different times, seem
compelling.
Given her new interest in Africa,
Pardis joined a research group
using genetic analysis to help
African-Americans trace their
genealogy back to regions of
Africa. After a year or so, Pardis
decided to switch labs, and she
moved into another, suggested by a
friend. This lab was tackling the
genetics of malaria.
After Oxford, Pardis returned to
Harvard Medical School to earn her
MD—amazingly, even as she was
finishing up a PhD in genetics, she
wasn’t ready yet to abandon her
earlier premonition that she was
somehow meant to be a doctor. The
result was that she became a young
med student finishing a PhD thesis
during her spare time. “If you want
to write a thing about having a
quality enjoyable life, don’t ask me
about my time at Harvard,” she
warned. “Harvard was a tough
time.”
Pardis finished her dissertation
and became a postdoctoral fellow,
continuing to juggle this work with
the end of her MD program, taking
the subway back and forth between
Harvard and MIT, where she was
now working at the Broad Institute
with the famed geneticist Eric
Lander. It was during this period
that her ideas about using statistical
analysis to find evidence of recent
human evolution begin to yield
results, culminating in the 2002
publication of a major paper in
Nature with the innocuous title:
“Detecting recent positive selection
in the human genome from
haplotype structure.”2
According to Google Scholar,
the work has been cited over 720
times since its publication. “People
started treating me differently after
that paper,” Pardis says. “That’s
when the faculty offers started
coming in.” Though she finished
her MD somewhere in this period, it
was not until this point that her
mission finally became clear:
Becoming a clinical doctor didn’t
make sense; she was going to build
a research career focused on her
use of computational genetics to
combat ancient diseases. Pardis
took a professorship at Harvard,
finally ready to commit to a single
focus in her working life.
What struck me about Pardis’s
story is how remarkably late it was
in her training before she identified
the mission that now defines her
career. This lateness is best
represented by her decision to still
attend—and finish!—medical
school even though she was
working on PhD research that was
starting to attract notice. These are
not the actions of someone who is
certain of her destiny from day one.
This certainty didn’t come until
later, around the time of her Nature
publication, when Pardis had finally
developed her computational
genetics ideas to the point where
their usefulness and novelty were
obvious.
To use my terminology, this long
period of training, starting with her
undergraduate biology classes and
continuing through her PhD and
then postdoctoral work at the Broad
Institute, was when she was
building up her stores of career
capital. When she took a
professorship at Harvard, she was
finally ready to cash in this capital
to obtain the mission-driven career
she enjoys today.
Rule #4 is entitled “Think Small,
Act Big.” It’s in this understanding
of career capital and its role in
mission that we get our explanation
for this title. Advancing to the
cutting edge in a field is an act of
“small” thinking, requiring you to
focus on a narrow collection of
subjects for a potentially long time.
Once you get to the cutting edge,
however, and discover a mission in
the adjacent possible, you must go
after it with zeal: a “big” action.
Pardis Sabeti thought small by
focusing patiently for years on a
narrow niche (the genetics of
diseases in Africa), but then acting
big once she acquired enough
capital to identify a mission (using
computational genetics to help
understand and fight ancient
diseases). Sarah and Jane, by
contrast, reversed this order. They
started by thinking big, looking for
a world-changing mission, but
without capital they could only
match this big thinking with small,
ineffectual acts. The art of mission,
we can conclude, asks us to
suppress the most grandiose of our
work instincts and instead adopt the
patience—the style of patience
observed with Pardis Sabeti—
required to get this ordering correct.
Chapter Fourteen
Missions Require Little Bets
In which I argue that great
missions are transformed into
great successes as the result of
using small and achievable
projects—little bets—to explore the
concrete possibilities surrounding
a compelling idea.
Leaping the Gap Between Idea and
Practice
My time with Pardis Sabeti
convinced me that career capital is
necessary to identify a good
mission. But even as this
understanding solidified, a nagging
thought kept spoiling my
intellectual satisfaction: Why don’t I
have a personal mission-driven
career?
When I met Pardis, I had a PhD
in computer science from MIT and
close to two dozen peer-reviewed
publications to my name. I’d given
talks on my work all over the
world, from Rio to Bologna to
Zurich. In other words, I had
accumulated career capital, and this
capital allowed me to identify many
potential missions relevant to my
skills. I even had a written record
of these brainstorms, as I always
keep an idea notebook with me. On
March 13, 2011, for example, I
recorded the possibility of focusing
my career on a new style of
distributed algorithm theory that
was just emerging—the study of
algorithms in communication
graphs with unrestrained topology
changes. I could, I noted, immerse
myself in its development much in
the same way the early proponents
of chaos theory did in their field
back in the early 1980s.
But this brings me back to my
nagging question. I had notebooks
filled with potential missions, yet I
had resisted devoting myself to any
one in particular. And I’m not alone
in this reluctance to act. Many
people have lots of career capital,
and can therefore identify a variety
of different potential missions for
their work, but few actually build
their career around such missions.
It seems, therefore, that there’s
more to this career tactic than
simply getting to the cutting edge.
Once you have the capital required
to identify a mission, you must still
figure out how to put the mission
into practice. If you don’t have a
trusted strategy for making this leap
from idea to execution, then like me
and so many others, you’ll probably
avoid the leap altogether.
This chapter is the first of two
that investigate people who have
successfully made this leap. My
goal for these investigations is to
find specific strategies that take you
from big idea to big results—the
type of strategies that can transform
the missions in my notebooks from
being merely ideas to becoming the
foundation of an attention-catching
career. We’ll start with the story of
a brash young archaeologist from a
small town in Southeast Texas:
someone who discovered a
systematic strategy for deploying a
bold mission in a field famous for
its conformity.
American Treasures
I first encountered Kirk French
while watching the Discovery
Channel. During a commercial
break, I saw an ad for the
network’s newest show. It was
called American Treasures. The
spot showed a pair of young
archaeologists, dressed in jeans and
battered work shirts, driving around
the American backcountry in an old
Ford F-150, helping people
determine the historical significance
of their family heirlooms. The
hosts, who were revealed to be
archaeologists Kirk French and
Jason De León, seemed loud and
energetic and enjoying the hell out
of what they were doing. It was like
Antiques Roadshow, but with
considerably more drinking and
cursing. I set my DVR to record the
premiere.
Early in this first episode, Kirk
and Jason find themselves in the
East Texas flatlands, at a run-down,
dirt-road homestead. They are there
to investigate the authenticity of a
suit of clothes that supposedly
belonged to Clyde Barrow of
Bonnie and Clyde fame.
It takes the archaeologists all of
thirty seconds to disprove this
claim: Not a lot of suits from that
period feature a “Made in China”
tag. But this doesn’t dampen their
enthusiasm.
“You’re from a moonshine
family,” notes French.
“Yep,” drawls Leslie, the suit’s
owner.
“Let’s try some moonshine.”
Soon a glass pitcher is produced.
As Leslie pours the hootch into
Mason jars, he offers a warning:
“Don’t ask about the proof. You
wouldn’t drink it if you knew.” As
Kirk and Jason sit on a pair of logs,
drinking the moonshine and
swapping stories, surrounded by
East Texas nothingness, they seem
to be having a great time.
I was hooked. To understand the
appeal of American Treasures, you
must understand its competition. At
the time, cable TV was overrun
with “cash for junk”–style shows,
such as the History Channel’s Pawn
Stars, which follows the staff of a
Las Vegas pawnshop as they try to
bargain cash-strapped people out of
valuable possessions; and the
Discovery Channel’s Auction
Kings, which follows the
adventures of an Atlanta-based
auction house whose website
deploys significantly more
exclamation points than, say,
Sotheby’s might approve of. These
shows, of course, are not to be
confused with Discovery’s
American Pickers, which also
follows a team that buys people’s
possessions, but now features the
key twist that the bargain hunters
travel in a van instead of working
out of a storefront. And none of
these should be confused with
either Discovery’s Auction Hunters
or the History Channel’s Storage
Wars, both of which take a hard-
hitting look at buying abandoned
storage units at auction—a topic too
nuanced, it seems, to be fully
plumbed by only a single series.
These programs never interested
me. But something about American
Treasures caught my attention. I
think once I looked past the name
—which Kirk later admitted to me
he both hated and fought against—I
was struck by the fact that the hosts
had a purpose beyond just wanting
to be on television. For one thing,
they aren’t full-time TV
personalities, but are instead
academic archaeologists. (The
Discovery Channel had to buy out a
semester of their teaching
obligations so they could film the
first season.) In addition, there’s no
exchanging of cash in this show (a
mainstay of all other entries in this
genre). Putting monetary value on
artifacts is antithetical to the mission
of archaeology, and Kirk and Jason
refused to do so in their show. The
hosts instead seem driven by the
idea that they’re educating the
public about the reality of modern
archaeology. This is their mission,
and as indicated by the smiles on
their faces as they sipped East Texas
moonshine in the premiere episode
of their show, it’s a mission that’s a
hell of a lot of fun to pursue.
Not long after meeting Pardis
Sabeti, around the time I started
questioning why I didn’t have a
mission-driven career, Kirk and
Jason popped back to mind. I
realized that they provided a perfect
case study of what it’s like to leap a
large gap between idea and practice.
The mission of popularizing
archaeology to a mass audience,
and having a fun time doing so,
sounds good on paper, but to
actually devote your career to this
mission, especially when you’re just
out of graduate school and trying to
make a name for yourself in a
traditional academic field, is a
terrifying prospect. I called up Kirk
to find out what strategy he used to
make this leap with confidence.
The Armchair Archaeologist
No one who knows him would
describe Kirk French as boring.
“After Bush won the election in
2004,” he told me, “I sort of lost it.
I sold everything and moved to the
woods.” The “woods” consisted of
sixteen acres of old farmland, and it
was a twenty-minute drive from the
Penn State campus, where Kirk was
a graduate student at the time.
While living in his “hermit”
mode, he decided to build a
wooden stage in an apple tree grove
not far from his cabin and organize
a music festival, which he called,
naturally, Kirk Fest. Jason De León,
a fellow grad student at Penn State,
had a band named Wilcox Hotel at
the time, which played at the
festival. He admired Kirk’s
entrepreneurial streak and asked if
he wanted to manage Wilcox Hotel.
Kirk thought it sounded like fun.
They ended up taking time off from
their graduate studies to buy a
minibus and “drive across the
country and back” on tour. They
also recorded two CDs during this
period. I tell these stories because
they emphasize that Kirk is
someone who is not afraid to try
something bold if it holds out the
promise of making his life more
interesting.
During this period as a graduate
student, Kirk, who specialized in
Mayan water management, was
interviewed for a History Channel
documentary on the Maya called
Lost Worlds. As someone always
seeking creative outlets for his
energy, this experience helped Kirk
cement a potential mission for his
career: to popularize modern
archaeology to a mass audience. His
first efforts to explore this direction
began after he graduated with his
PhD and became a postdoc, and
they centered on a classic 1961
documentary called Land and
Water: An Ecological Study of the
Teotihuacan Valley of Mexico,
filmed by the late Penn State
archaeologist William Sanders. This
film documents how the rise of
Mexico City has transformed the
ecology and lifestyle in the
Teotihuacan Valley. For those, like
Kirk, who study historical ecology,
it’s an influential film.
In the fall of 2009, Kirk got his
hands on the original 16 mm reels,
including outtakes that never made
the original cut, as well as Sanders’s
notes. He launched two projects
surrounding this find. The first was
to digitize the original film footage
and release a DVD of the original
documentary—a project he
completed in the spring of 2010.
The second project was more
ambitious. He decided to film a new
version of the documentary—an
update that would show the further
changes that have happened
between the 1960s and the present
in the valley. Kirk raised seed
money from Penn State’s
anthropology department and the
Maya Exploration Center, put
together a team, and in the winter of
2010 headed down to Mexico City
to begin filming sample footage.
The goal was to pull together
enough compelling shots to
“convince funding agencies of the
importance of [the project].”
Kirk’s breakthrough for his
mission, however, began in
December 2009. George Milner, a
professor in the office next to Kirk,
called him in to join a group of
archaeologists who were all
standing around Milner’s phone.
“You’ve got to listen to this
message,” he said while dialing in
to his voice mail. The recording
was of a man who lived just north
of Pittsburgh. He sounded articulate
and thoughtful—at least, until he
got to the reason he was calling the
Penn State archaeology department.
“I’ve got what I think is the treasure
of the Knights Templar in my
backyard,” he explained.
The gathered academics all had a
good laugh. But then Kirk
interjected: “I’m going to call him
back.” His more experienced
colleagues tried to talk him out of it.
“He will never leave you alone,”
they told him. “He will call you
back every week and keep asking
you questions.”
As Kirk explained to me, in an
academic field like archaeology,
you get a lot of these types of calls
—“people who think they found a
dinosaur footprint, or whatever”—
and there’s just not time, with the
pressure of research and teaching,
to keep up with them. But Kirk saw
an opportunity here that would
support his mission. “This type of
public outreach is exactly what we
archaeologists should be doing,” he
realized.
He decided he was going to
follow up on the random calls that
came in to the department. He
planned to go meet the people, hear
their stories, and help explain how
the principles of archaeology can
lead them to figure out whether or
not a medieval organization of
knights was actually traipsing
around the hills of Pittsburgh. Not
only would he meet them but he
would also film the encounters,
with the eventual goal of producing
a documentary on the most
interesting case. He called the
project The Armchair
Archaeologist. He envisioned this
side project taking five or ten years
—something to work on alongside
his filming in the Teotihuacan
Valley. “I figured, at the very least,
I could show it to the students in
my intro archaeology classes,” he
said.
On a Sunday morning, not long
after hearing the call about the
Knights Templar treasure, Kirk
gathered a cameraman and
soundman, and headed out to
Pittsburgh to investigate the claim.
“He was the coolest guy,” Kirk
recalls. “He had crazy ideas, but he
was fun to talk to. We hung out all
day, and had some beers, and
chatted.” The “treasure,” it turns
out, was just some old deer bones
and railroad spikes found in a
gravel pit, but the experience was
invigorating for Kirk. It also turned
out to be more consequential than
he could ever have guessed.
Around this time, the Discovery
Channel decided it wanted a reality
show that had something to do with
archaeology. As is common in the
TV business, instead of developing
the idea themselves, the channel
instead spread word of their general
interest, and left it to independent
production companies to pull
together specific show concepts.
Three months after Kirk filmed his
Pittsburgh footage, one of these
production companies contacted the
head of the archaeology department
at Penn State, who forwarded the
message to the whole staff. “Sure I
had only three months of
experience on my job as a lecturer
at the time,” Kirk recalled, “but I
was really interested in media, so I
thought, ‘Why not me?’ ” Kirk
followed up with the production
company. “I have your show idea,”
he told them, not long into their
initial conversation. He sent them
his Armchair Archaeologist
footage.
The production company loved
the idea and they loved Kirk. They
refilmed his visit to the Templars’
treasure site and sent the tape to the
Discovery Channel and the History
Channel. The latter agreed to
finance a pilot, but the former said,
“Screw a pilot, let’s film eight
episodes.” When they asked Kirk
about a cohost, he had only one
name to offer, his good friend
Jason De León, who had also
recently graduated Penn State and
had just started as an assistant
professor at Michigan. They both
arranged for the Discovery Channel
to buy out their teaching obligations
for the following fall, and then hit
the road to film the first season of
what would become American
Treasures.1
Leveraging Little Bets
Kirk’s mission was to popularize
archaeology, and he wanted to do
so in a way that generated an
exciting life. Hosting American
Treasures made this mission a
reality. The question at hand is how
he made this leap from a general
idea into specific action.
Here’s what I noticed: Kirk’s
path to American Treasures was
incremental. He didn’t decide out of
nowhere that he wanted to host a
television show and then work
backward to make that dream a
reality. Instead, he worked forward
from his original mission—to
popularize archaeology—with a
series of small, almost tentative
steps. When he stumbled on the old
film reels for Land and Water, for
example, he decided to digitize
them and produce a DVD. After
this small step he took the slightly
larger step of raising money to
shoot exploratory footage for a new
version of the documentary. When
George Milner played him that
fateful answering machine tape,
Kirk took another modest step by
launching The Armchair
Archaeologist project with no real
vision of how it would prove
useful, other than perhaps as fodder
for his intro archaeology courses.
This final little step, however,
turned out to be a winner, leading
directly to his own television show.
As I was struggling to make
sense of Kirk’s story, I stumbled
across a new business book that
had been making waves. It was
titled Little Bets, and it was written
by a former venture capitalist
named Peter Sims.2 When Sims
studied a variety of successful
innovators, from Steve Jobs to
Chris Rock to Frank Gehry, as well
as innovative companies, such as
Amazon and Pixar, he found a
strategy common to all. “Rather
than believing they have to start
with a big idea or plan out a whole
project in advance,” he writes, “they
make a methodical series of little
bets about what might be a good
direction, learning critical
information from lots of little
failures and from small but
significant wins” [emphasis mine].
This rapid and frequent feedback,
Sims argues, “allows them to find
unexpected avenues and arrive at
extraordinary outcomes.”
To illustrate this idea, Sims
details the example of Chris Rock
preparing a comedy set for one of
his acclaimed HBO specials. Rock,
it turns out, will make somewhere
between forty to fifty unannounced
visits to a small New Jersey–area
comedy club to help him figure out
which material works and which
doesn’t. As Sims notes, he shows
up on stage with a yellow legal pad,
working through different jokes,
taking notes on the crowd’s
reaction. Most of the material falls
flat. It’s not uncommon for Rock to
look up and say, “This needs to be
fleshed out more,” while the crowd
laughs at the awkwardness of
Rock’s flops. But these little
failures, combined with the little
victories of the jokes that connect,
provide the key information
required for Rock to put together an
extraordinary set.
This style of little bets, I realized,
is what Kirk deployed to feel out
his mission of popularizing
archaeology. He tried releasing a
DVD, filming a documentary, and
putting together a film series for his
students. The latter ended up the
most promising, but Kirk couldn’t
have known this in advance. The
important thing about little bets is
that they’re bite-sized. You try one.
It takes a few months at most. It
either succeeds or fails, but either
way you get important feedback to
guide your next steps. This
approach stands in contrast to the
idea of choosing a bold plan and
making one big bet on its success.
If Kirk had done this—for example,
deciding in advance to dedicate
years to popularizing the Land and
Water documentary—he would not
have had nearly as much success
with his mission.
When I looked back to Pardis
Sabeti’s story, I noticed the little-
bets strategy at play here as well. As
you’ll recall, she decided early in
her graduate student career to
pursue the general mission of
tackling infectious disease in Africa.
But at this stage, she didn’t know
how to make this mission
successful, so she launched small
experiments. She started in a
research lab working on the genetic
heritage of African-Americans. This
didn’t seem quite right, so she
moved to a group that worked on
malaria—but again, she didn’t see a
clear path to making her mission a
success. Returning to Harvard, she
began work as a postdoctoral
fellow at the Broad Institute. It was
here that she began to gain traction
for her computational approach to
seeking out markers of natural
selection in the human genome. It
was this last bet—out of a long
string of such bets—that proved to
be a big winner, at which point she
dedicated her career to its pursuit. It
was tentativeness, not boldness, that
transformed Pardis’s general
mission into a specific success.
A Brief Mission Intermission
Let’s take a moment to pull together
what we’ve learned so far about
mission. In the last chapter, I used
Pardis Sabeti’s story to emphasize
that you need career capital before
you can identify a realistic mission
for your career. Just because you
have a good idea for a mission,
however, doesn’t mean that you’ll
succeed in its pursuit. With this in
mind, in this chapter we studied the
life of Kirk French to better
understand how you make the leap
from identifying a realistic mission
to succeeding in making it a reality.
Here we discovered the
importance of little bets. To
maximize your chances of success,
you should deploy small, concrete
experiments that return concrete
feedback. For Chris Rock, such a
bet might include telling a joke to
an audience and seeing if they
laugh, whereas for Kirk, it might
mean producing sample footage for
a documentary and seeing if it
attracts funding. These bets allow
you to tentatively explore the
specific avenues surrounding your
general mission, looking for those
with the highest likelihood of
leading to outstanding results.
If career capital makes it possible
to identify a compelling mission,
then it’s a strategy of little bets that
gives you a good shot of
succeeding in this mission. To
deploy this career tactic, you need
both pieces. As you’ll learn in the
next chapter, however, the story of
mission is not yet complete. As I
continued my study of this topic, I
discovered a third and final strategy
for helping to integrate this trait into
your quest for work you love.
Chapter Fifteen
Missions Require Marketing
In which I argue that great
missions are transformed into
great successes as the result of
finding projects that satisfy the law
of remarkability, which requires
that an idea inspires people to
remark about it, and is launched in
a venue where such remarking is
made easy.
The Remarkable Life of Giles
Bowkett
Giles Bowkett loves what he does
for a living. In fact, my first
encounter with Giles was an e-mail
he sent me with the subject line:
“My remarkable life.”
Giles, however, didn’t always
love his career. There were points
when he was broke and
unemployed, and other points when
he suffered through jobs that bored
him into a stupor. The turning point
came in 2008 when Giles became a
rock star in the community of
computer programmers who
specialize in a language called
Ruby. “It seems as if every Ruby
programmer on the planet knows
my name,” he told me, reflecting on
his newfound celebrity. “I literally
met people from Argentina and
Norway who not only knew who I
was but were absolutely shocked
that I didn’t expect them to know
who I was.”
I’ll dive into the details of how
Giles became a star soon, but what I
want to emphasize now is that this
fame allowed him to take control of
his career and to transform it into
something he loves. “I had a lot of
interest from companies in San
Francisco and Silicon Valley,” he
told me, reflecting on the period
that began in 2008. He decided to
take a job with ENTP, one of the
country’s top Ruby programming
firms. They doubled his salary and
put him to work on interesting
projects. In 2009, Giles was bit by
an entrepreneurial bug. He left
ENTP and built up a blog and a
collection of mini–Web applications
that soon brought in enough money
to support him. “I had an audience
who wanted to know what I
thought about a whole ton of
different things,” he told me. “In
many cases they were happy to pay
money just to ask me questions.”
Eventually, he decided that he
had had his fill with the solo
lifestyle (“working from home is
kind of lame when you don’t have
roommates, a girlfriend, or even a
dog”), so he pursued a longstanding
interest in filmmaking by going to
work for hitRECord: a company
started by actor Joseph Gordon-
Levitt that provides a Web-based
platform for collaborative media
projects. It’s not that the money was
great (“the Hollywood
understanding of what
programmers get paid is wildly
inaccurate”), but just that it sounded
like a lot of fun—one of Giles’s
most important criteria for his
working life. “It was a pretty great
experience,” he told me. “I got to
hang out with one of the stars of
Inception and the next Batman,
drinking beers at his house, that
kind of thing.” Not long after I met
Giles, after he had successfully
scratched his Hollywood itch, he
once again moved on. A publisher
had asked him to write a book, and
he had agreed—and why not? It
seemed like an interesting thing to
do.
The speed with which Giles
bounces from opportunity to
opportunity might seem
disorienting, but this lifestyle is a
perfect match for his hyperkinetic
personality. One of Giles’s favorite
presentation techniques, for
example, is to begin talking faster
and faster, accompanying his
speech with a rapid series of slides,
each featuring a single keyword that
flashes on the screen at the exact
moment that he utters the term—the
oratorical equivalent of a caffeine
rush. In other words, he used his
capital to build a career custom-fit
to his personality, which is why he
now loves his working life.
The reason I’m telling Giles’s
story here in Rule #4 is that at the
core of his rise to fame was his
mission. In more detail, Giles
committed himself to the mission of
bringing together the worlds of art
and Ruby programming. He made
good on this commitment when he
released Archaeopteryx, an open-
source artificial intelligence
program that writes and plays its
own dance music. Watching
Archaeopteryx in action can be
eerie: An innocuous command
typed into the Mac command line
starts an aggressive and complicated
techno breakbeat; a single value is
changed in the Bayesian probability
matrices underlying the AI engine;
and all of a sudden the beat
transforms into something entirely
different. It’s as if musical creativity
itself has been reduced to a series of
equations and some lines of terse
code. This feat made Giles a star.
But the question that interests me
most about Giles is how he made
the leap from a general mission—to
bring together art and Ruby
programming—to a specific, fame-
inducing project: Archaeopteryx. In
the last chapter, I highlighted the
importance of using little bets to
feel out a good way forward from
general mission to specific project.
Giles, however, adds another layer
of nuance to this goal. He
approached the task of finding
good projects for his mission with
the mindset of a marketer,
systematically studying books on
the subject to help identify why
some ideas catch on while others
fall flat. His marketing-centric
approach is useful for anyone
looking to wield mission as part of
their quest for work they love.
Purple Cows and Open-Source
Rock Stars
Giles’s career story starts when he
left Santa Fe College after his first
year. He tried writing screenplays,
“but they weren’t good,” and he
tried writing music, “which I was
better at, but which didn’t pay.” He
also temped. Artistic in nature,
Giles was drawn to the graphic
designers in the companies where
he worked and they introduced him
to quirky new markup language that
was poised to change the world of
design—a language called HTML.
Giles built his first Web page in
1994, and in 1996 he moved to San
Francisco, bringing with him books
on Java and Perl, programming
languages that provided the
foundation of the early Web. He
made $30,000 in 1994. In 1996 this
jumped to $100,000: The dot-com
boom was picking up speed and
Giles was in the right place with the
right skills at the right time.
At first, things went well for
Giles in San Francisco. He enjoyed
designing websites and in his free
time he became involved in the
local DJ scene. But careers have
their own sort of momentum, and
he soon found himself
programming for an investment
bank. “I was bored out of my
mind,” he recalls, “so I decided to
do something bold: I was going to
apply to a really interesting start-
up.” The day after he submitted his
application the start-up went under.
The first dot-com crash had begun.
“Pretty soon I was the only one of
my friends who had a job at all,” he
recalled. “I talked to a recruiter
about finding something I liked
better, and he said I should be
thrilled to have a job.”
Giles being Giles, however, he
ignored the recruiter, quit his job,
and moved back to Santa Fe. He
lived in a rented camper on his
parents’ land, helping them build a
solar-powered house while taking
courses at the local community
college. He studied painting, voice,
piano, and perhaps most
importantly, studio engineering, the
class that introduced him to
aleatoric music: composition using
algorithms. It’s here, among the
desert landscapes and arts courses,
that Giles made a key decision. A
career untamed, he realized, can
bring you into dangerous territory,
such as being bored while writing
computer code for an investment
bank. He needed a mission to
actively guide his career or he
would end up trapped again and
again. He decided that a good
mission for him would somehow
combine the artistic and technical
sides of his life, but he didn’t know
how to make this general idea into a
money-making reality, so he went
searching for answers. He found
what he was looking for in an
unlikely pair of books.
“You’re either remarkable or
invisible,” says Seth Godin in his
2002 bestseller, Purple Cow.1 As he
elaborated in a Fast Company
manifesto he published on the
subject: “The world is full of boring
stuff—brown cows—which is why
so few people pay attention…. A
purple cow… now that would stand
out. Remarkable marketing is the
art of building things worth
noticing.”2 When Giles read
Godin’s book, he had an epiphany:
For his mission to build a
sustainable career, it had to produce
purple cows, the type of remarkable
projects that compel people to
spread the word.
But this left him with a second
question: In the world of computer
programming, where does one
launch remarkable projects? He
found his second answer in a 2005
career guide with a quirky title: My
Job Went to India: 52 Ways to
Save Your Job.3 The book was
written by Chad Fowler, a well-
known Ruby programmer who also
dabbles in career advice for
software developers. Featured
among Fowler’s fifty-two strategies
is the idea that the job seeker
should leverage the open-source
software movement. This
movement brings together
computer programmers who
volunteer their time to build
software that’s freely available and
modifiable. Fowler argued that this
community is well respected and
highly visible. If you want to make
a name for yourself in software
development—the type of name
that can help you secure
employment—focus your attention
on making quality contributions to
open-source projects. This is where
the people who matter look for
talent.
“At this point I basically just put
two and two together,” Giles told
me. “The synthesis of Purple Cow
and My Job Went to India is that
the best way to market yourself as a
programmer is to create remarkable
open-source software. So I did.”
Following Godin’s advice, Giles
came up with the idea for
Archaeopteryx, his AI-driven music
creator. “I don’t think there was
anybody else with my combined
background,” he said. “Plenty of
Ruby programmers love dance
music, but I don’t think any of
them has sacrificed the same
ridiculous number of hours to
tweaking breakbeats and synth
patches over and over again,
releasing white-label records that
never made a dime, and studying
music theory.” In other words,
Giles’s ability to produce a Ruby
program that produced real music
was unique: If he could pull it off,
it would be a purple cow.
Drawing from Fowler’s advice,
Giles then decided that the open-
source community was the perfect
place to introduce this purple cow
to the world. In addition to
releasing the Archaeopteryx code as
open source, he took to the road to
spread the word. “I basically took
Chad Fowler’s advice way too far
and went to speak at almost every
user group and conference that I
could—at least fifteen in 2008,”
Giles recalled. This hybrid
Godin/Fowler strategy worked. “I
got offers from all over the place,”
Giles recalled. “I got to work with
stars in my industry, I got
approached to write a book on
Archaeopteryx, I could charge a lot
more money than I used to.” It was,
in other words, a strategy that made
his mission into a success.
The Law of Remarkability
Reflecting on Giles’s story, I kept
coming back to the same adjective:
“remarkable.” What Giles
discovered, I decided, is that a good
mission-driven project must be
remarkable in two different ways.
First, it should be remarkable in the
literal sense of compelling people to
remark about it. To understand this
trait, let’s first look at something
that lacks it. Before releasing
Archaeopteryx, Giles had worked
on another open-source project. He
collected popular command-line
tools for Ruby and combined them
into one package with consistent
documentation. If you asked a
Ruby programmer about this
project, he would tell you that this
is solid, quality, useful work. But
it’s not the type of achievement that
would compel this same Ruby
programmer to write his friends and
tell them, “You have to see this!”
In the words of Seth Godin, this
early project was a “brown cow.”
By contrast, teaching your computer
to write its own complex music is a
purple cow; it inspires people to
take notice and spread the word.
What’s nice about this first
notion of remarkability is that it can
be applied to any field. Take book
writing: If I published a book of
solid advice for helping recent
graduates transition to the job
market, you might find this a useful
contribution, but probably wouldn’t
find yourself whipping out your
iPhone and Tweeting its praises. On
the other hand, if I publish a book
that says “follow your passion” is
bad advice, (hopefully) this would
compel you to spread the word.
That is, the book you’re holding
was conceived from the very early
stages with the hope of being seen
as “remarkable.”
There’s also, however, a second
type of remarkability at play. Giles
didn’t just find a project that
compels remarks, but he also
spread the word about the project in
a venue that supports these
remarks. In his case, this venue was
the open-source software
community. As he learned from
Chad Fowler, there’s an established
infrastructure in this community for
noticing and spreading the word
about interesting projects. Without
this conduciveness to chatter, a
purple cow, though striking, may
never be seen. To be more
concrete, if Giles had instead
released Archaeopteryx as a closed-
source piece of commercial
software, perhaps trying to sell it
from a slick website or at music
conventions, it probably wouldn’t
have caught fire as it did.
Once again, this notion of
remarkability applies beyond just
Giles’s world of Ruby
programming. If we return to my
example of writing career-advice
books, I realized early on in my
process that blogging was a
remarkable venue for introducing
my ideas. Blogs are visible and the
infrastructure is in place for good
ideas to quickly spread, through,
for example, linking, Tweets, and
Facebook. Because of this
conduciveness to remarking, by the
time I pitched this book to
publishers, I not only had a large
audience who appreciated my views
on passion and skill, but the meme
had spread: Newspapers and major
websites around the world had
begun to quote my thoughts on the
topic, while the articles had been
cited online and Tweeted thousands
of times. If I had instead decided to
confine my ideas to paid speaking
gigs, for example, my mission to
change the way we think about
careers would have likely stagnated
—the venue would not have been
sufficiently remarkable.
To help organize our thinking,
I’ll summarize these ideas in a
succinct law:
The Law of Remarkability
For a mission-driven project
to succeed, it should be
remarkable in two different
ways. First, it must compel
people who encounter it to
remark about it to others.
Second, it must be launched
in a venue that supports such
remarking.
Once I had articulated this law, I
began to notice it at play in the
examples I had previously found of
mission leading to a compelling
career. To help cement this
marketing-centric approach to
mission, it’s worth taking a moment
to return to these examples and
highlight the law in action.
The Law in Action
Pardis Sabeti’s general mission was
to use genetics to help fight
infectious disease in Africa. This is
a fine mission, but by itself it does
not guarantee the type of fulfilling
life Pardis leads. In fact, lots of
researchers share this mission, and
are doing good, basic science—
such as sequencing the genes of
viruses—but don’t have particularly
compelling careers. Pardis, by
contrast, pursued this mission by
launching an arresting project:
using powerful computers to seek
out examples of humans evolving
resistance to ancient diseases. If you
want evidence of the remarkability
of this approach, look no farther
than the catchy headlines of the
many articles that have been penned
on the Sabeti Lab—articles with
titles such as “5 Questions for the
Woman Who Tracks Our DNA
Footprints” (Discover, April 2010),
“Picking Up Evolution’s Beat”
(Science, April 2008), and “Are We
Still Evolving?” (BBC Horizon,
March 2011). This is a project that
compels people to spread the word.
It is a purple cow.
By seeking a remarkable project,
Pardis satisfied the first part of the
law of remarkability. The second
part requires that she launch her
project in a venue that supports
remarking. For Pardis, as with all
scientists, this is the easy part. Peer-
reviewed publication is a system
built around the idea of allowing
good ideas to spread. The better the
idea, the better the journal it gets
published in. The better the journal
an article is published in, the more
people who read it. And the more
people who read it, the more it gets
cited, discussed at conferences, and
in general affects the field. If you’re
a scientist with a remarkable idea,
there’s little doubt about how best
to spread it: publish! This is exactly
what Pardis did with the Nature
article that jump-started her
reputation.
With Kirk French, we also see
the law of remarkability in action.
His general mission was to
popularize modern archaeology.
There are lots of non-remarkable
ways to pursue this mission. For
example, he could have worked on
making the archaeology curriculum
at Penn State more appealing to
undergraduates, or published
articles on the field in general-
interest science magazines. But
these projects would not have
generated the type of attention-
grabbing success that can transform
your career into something
compelling. Instead, Kirk decided
to head straight into people’s homes
and use archaeological techniques
to help them uncover the
significance (if any) of family
treasures. This approach is
remarkable—an observation
reinforced by the number of
speaking invitations Kirk now
receives, including a recent
opportunity to address the largest
conference in his field about
lessons learned as a popularizer.
When he gave the address, the
crowd overflowed the auditorium
(an impressive feat for someone
who had just earned his doctorate).
In this example, Kirk had a
remarkable project to support his
mission—now all he needed was a
venue conducive to remarking. He
found this remarkable venue with
television. We’re a society trained
to watch what’s on and then discuss
what caught our attention the next
day.
Summary of Rule #4
The core idea of this book is
simple: To construct work you
love, you must first build career
capital by mastering rare and
valuable skills, and then cash in this
capital for the type of traits that
define compelling careers. Mission
is one of those traits.
In the first chapter of this rule, I
reinforced the idea that this trait,
like all desirable career traits, really
does require career capital—you
can’t skip straight into a great
mission without first building
mastery in your field. Drawing
from the terminology of Steven
Johnson, I argued that the best
ideas for missions are found in the
adjacent possible—the region just
beyond the current cutting edge.
To encounter these ideas,
therefore, you must first get to that
cutting edge, which in turn requires
expertise. To try to devise a mission
when you’re new to a field and
lacking any career capital is a
venture bound for failure.
Once you identify a general
mission, however, you’re still left
with the task of launching specific
projects that make it succeed. An
effective strategy for accomplishing
this task is to try small steps that
generate concrete feedback—little
bets—and then use this feedback,
be it good or bad, to help figure out
what to try next. This systematic
exploration can help you uncover
an exceptional way forward that
you might have never otherwise
noticed.
The little-bets strategy, I
discovered as my research into
mission continued, is not the only
way to make a mission a success. It
also helps to adopt the mindset of a
marketer. This led to the strategy
that I dubbed the law of
remarkability.
This law says that for a project to
transform a mission into a success,
it should be remarkable in two
ways. First, it must literally compel
people to remark about it. Second,
it must be launched in a venue
conducive to such remarking.
In sum, mission is one of the
most important traits you can
acquire with your career capital. But
adding this trait to your working
life is not simple. Once you have
the capital to identify a good
mission, you must still work to
make it succeed. By using little bets
and the law of remarkability, you
greatly increase your chances of
finding ways to transform your
mission from a compelling idea into
a compelling career.
Conclusion
My Story Resumes
In the introduction to this book I
described the circumstances that
launched me on the quest you just
finished reading about. My time as
a graduate student and postdoc was
winding down, and I was about to
enter the academic-job market.
Succeeding as a professor, I knew,
was not an easy task. If you’re not
in control of your career, it can
chew you up and spit you out. To
make matters worse, I was entering
the market in a bad economy, so
there was a chance I might not find
a suitable academic position at all,
which would force me to start from
scratch in my career thinking. This
uncertainty made the following
question suddenly seem pressing:
How do people end up loving what
they do?
In the fall of 2010 I sent out my
applications for academic jobs. By
early December I had applied to
twenty positions. A curious quirk
of the academic-job search process
is that your colleagues expect it to
be demanding, so they keep tasks
off your desk. And though the
process is in fact demanding, these
demands come in bursts, leaving
long stretches of downtime in
between. Without much work to fill
these stretches, you can find
yourself uncomfortably idle. So it
was that as November gave way to
December, and I finished
submitting my twenty applications,
I had, for the first time since my
college summer vacations, not
much to do.
With free time on my hands, I
could finally begin to tackle my
quest in earnest. It was at this point
that I began to seek out people’s
career stories, both successes and
failures, to see what I could learn. It
was in November, for example, that
I first met Thomas, whose tale
opened this book. The stories I
encountered that fall cemented an
idea that I had long suspected to be
true: “Follow your passion” is bad
advice. But this validation only
brought forward the more difficult
task of figuring out what career-
happiness strategies do work.
My search for this answer was
put on hold in January and
February as my job search process
picked up steam. I began to prepare
my job talk and sift through the
interview offers that started to
trickle in. In early March I went on
an interview trip that included a
stop at Georgetown University.
Everything about Georgetown felt
right. Fortunately, I had another
offer at the time with a tight
deadline. I told my contacts at
Georgetown that I enjoyed my visit
and was interested in the position
but that I had a fast-approaching
deadline. Later that night I received
the key e-mail from the head of
their search committee. It was terse,
just three sentences:
We will have an offer for you
on Thursday. We just need to
know where to contact you to
communicate it in the
afternoon. Will your cell
phone be the best way to
reach you?
I turned down a pair of
interviews that had been scheduled
for later in the spring and accepted
the Georgetown offer. My career
die had been cast: I was going to be
a professor. It was the second week
of March when I formally took
myself off the market. My start date
would be in August. This left a gap
of four months to finalize my
answers to my pressing career
questions: I now had a job, but I
needed to figure out how to
transform it into one I loved.
During that spring and subsequent
summer, I hit the road, conducting
the interviews that formed the core
of Rules #2–4.
As I’m writing this conclusion,
I’m now two weeks away from my
first semester as a professor. I have
been working hard over the past
several months to not only finish
the quest I described in this book,
but also to write up my experiences
in the form in which you just
encountered them. (I signed the
deal for this book only two weeks
after accepting my Georgetown
offer.) This conclusion is the last
piece of this book to be written, and
the timing couldn’t be better. I’ll be
handing in this manuscript mere
days before turning my attention to
my new life as a professor—
allowing me to start this new
chapter of my career with
confidence in what I should do to
push it somewhere remarkable.
My quest, of course, uncovered
several surprising ideas. If your
goal is to love what you do, I
discovered, “follow you passion”
can be bad advice. It’s more
important to become good at
something rare and valuable, and
then invest the career capital this
generates into the type of traits that
make a job great. The traits of
control and mission are two good
places to start. My goal for this final
part of the book is to describe how
I am applying these ideas in my
own working life. That is, I want to
take you inside my thought process
and highlight the specific ways in
which the insights of Rules #1–4
are playing a role in this early stage
of my new career. Obviously these
applications are tentative—I have
not yet been a professor long
enough to see how they will all play
out—but it’s this tentativeness, I
think, that makes them more
relevant. They provide a real-world
example of the type of concrete
actions you can take right now to
start applying the lessons of this
book in your own working life.
Your decisions will differ from
mine, but I hope that you’ll
encounter in this conclusion a better
sense of what it means to re-form a
career to match this new way of
thinking about creating work you
love.
How I Applied Rule #1
Rule #1 argued that “follow your
passion” is bad advice, as the vast
majority of people don’t have pre-
existing passions waiting to be
discovered and matched to a career.
The real path to work you love, it
noted, is often more complicated.
This insight was not one that I
encountered for the first time
during my quest, but was instead
something I had long suspected to
be true. Although the chapter on
Rule #1 describes my recent efforts
to find real evidence for this
intuition, the seeds for this thought
had been planted long before.
The story of my passion aversion
starts in high school, when my
friend Michael Simmons and I
started a Web design company. We
called it Princeton Web Solutions.
The origin of our company was
modest. It was the late 1990s—the
first dot-com boom—and the media
was obsessed with stories of
teenage CEOs earning millions.
Michael and I thought this sounded
like fun—certainly a better way to
make money than our standard
summer jobs. We tried to think up a
creative new idea for a high-tech
company—something along the
lines of a new Amazon.com—but
we were stumped and ended up
defaulting to an idea that we had
earlier vowed we wouldn’t pursue:
designing websites. To be clear, we
were by no means following our
true calling. We were bored,
available, and ambitious—a
dangerous combination—and
starting a company sounded as
promising as anything else we
could imagine.
Princeton Web Solutions wasn’t
a meteoric success, but this was
partly by design, as we didn’t really
want to invest the time required to
grow a serious company. During
our senior year of high school we
worked with six or seven clients,
including a local architecture firm, a
local technical college, and an ill-
conceived—but oddly well-funded
—Web portal targeting the elderly.
Most of these contracts paid
between $5,000 and $10,000, a
healthy chunk of which we passed
on to a team of Indian
subcontractors, who did most of the
actual programming work. When
Michael and I left for college—he
to NYU and I to Dartmouth—I
decided I was done with website
design and moved on to more
pressing interests, such as girls.
For many in my generation, the
rejection of “follow your passion”
as career advice is heretical. I never
felt this same attraction to the cult
of passion, and for this I give credit
to my experience with Princeton
Web Solutions. As I mentioned,
starting this company had nothing
to do with me following a passion.
Once Michael and I figured out
how to keep the business humming,
however, this skill turned out to be
rare and valuable (especially for
people our age). This career capital
could then be cashed in for a
variety of different exciting
experiences. We got to wear suits
and make pitches to boardrooms.
We made enough money to never
have to worry about not being able
to afford the types of things
teenagers buy. Our teachers were
impressed by the company and
allowed us to unofficially ditch
classes for meetings. Magazines
wrote about us, photographers
came to take our pictures for
newspapers, and the whole
experience certainly played a large
role in our being admitted to elite
colleges.
The traits that can make your life
interesting, I learned, had very little
to do with intensive soul-searching.
Princeton Web Solutions, in other
words, had inoculated me against
the idea that occupational happiness
requires a calling.
Because of these early
experiences, I looked on with
curiosity, once I arrived at college,
when my classmates began to wring
their hands about the question of
what they wanted to do with their
lives. For them, something as basic
as choosing a major became
weighted with cosmic significance.
I thought this was nonsense. To me,
the world was filled with
opportunities like Princeton Web
Solutions waiting to be exploited to
make your life more interesting—
opportunities that had nothing to do
with identifying predestined
dispositions.
Driven by this insight, while my
classmates contemplated their true
calling, I went seeking
opportunities to master rare skills
that would yield big rewards. I
started by hacking my study skills
to become as efficient as possible.
This took one semester of
systematic experiments and
subsequently earned me three
consecutive years of a 4.0 grade
point average, a period during
which I never pulled an all-nighter
and rarely studied past dinner. I
then cashed in this asset by
publishing a student-advice guide.
These experiences helped me build
an exciting student life—I was, I
imagine, the only student on
Dartmouth’s campus taking regular
calls from his literary agent—but
neither came from the pursuit of a
pre-existing passion. Indeed, the
motivation to write my first book
was an idle dare leveled by an
entrepreneur I admired whom I met
one night for drinks: “Don’t just
talk about it,” he scolded me when I
offhandedly mentioned the book
idea. “If you think it would be cool,
go do it.” This seemed as good a
reason as any for me to proceed.
When it later came time for me
to decide what to do after college, I
had two offers in hand, one from
Microsoft and the other from MIT.
This is the type of decision that
would paralyze my classmates. I,
however, didn’t see any reason to
worry. Both paths, I was sure,
would yield numerous
opportunities that could be
leveraged into a remarkable life. I
ended up choosing MIT—among
other reasons, in order to stay
closer to my girlfriend.
The point I’m trying to make in
this section is that the core insight
of Rule #1 came to me before my
quest started, and in fact was
something I internalized as early as
high school. When I came to the
fall of 2011, therefore, and was
facing the period of uncertainty
when I wasn’t sure if I would
become a professor or end up
doing something completely
different, this Rule #1 mindset
saved me from needless fretting
about which of these paths forward
was my true calling. If tackled
correctly, I was absolutely
confident that either could yield a
career I love. Figuring out how to
achieve this goal, however, was less
certain, and it was this question that
led me to the insights described in
Rules #2–4.
How I Applied Rule #2
Rule #1 argued that “follow your
passion” is bad advice. This
provided the motivation for my
quest to figure out what does matter
in creating work you love. Rule #2
described the first insight I
encountered once my quest was
under way. The things that make
great work great, it argued, are rare
and valuable. If you want them in
your career, you need rare and
valuable skills to offer in return. In
other words, if you’re not putting in
the effort to become, as Steve
Martin put it, “so good they can’t
ignore you,” you’re not likely to
end up loving your work—
regardless of whether or not you
believe it’s your true calling.
I introduced the term career
capital to describe these rare and
valuable skills, and noted that the
tricky part is figuring out how to
acquire this capital. By definition, if
it’s rare and valuable, it’s not easy
to get. This insight brought me into
the world of performance science,
where I encountered the concept of
deliberate practice—a method for
building skills by ruthlessly
stretching yourself beyond where
you’re comfortable. As I
discovered, musicians, athletes, and
chess players, among others, know
all about deliberate practice, but
knowledge workers do not. Most
knowledge workers avoid the
uncomfortable strain of deliberate
practice like the plague, a reality
emphasized by the typical cubicle
dweller’s obsessive e-mail–
checking habit—for what is this
behavior if not an escape from
work that’s more mentally
demanding?
As I researched these ideas, I
became increasingly worried about
the current state of my academic
career. I feared that my rate of
acquiring career capital was
tapering off. To understand this
worry, you should understand that
graduate school, and the
postdoctoral years that often follow,
provide an uneven growth
experience. Early in this process
you’re constantly pushed into
intellectual discomfort. A graduate-
level mathematics problem set—
something I have plenty of
experience with—is about as pure
an exercise in deliberate practice as
you’re likely to find. You’re given a
problem that you have no idea how
to solve, but you have to solve it or
you’ll get a bad grade, so you dive
in and try as hard as you can,
repeatedly failing as different
avenues lead you to dead ends. The
mental strain of mustering every
last available neuron toward solving
a problem, driven by the fear of
earning zero points on the
assignment, is a nice encapsulation
of exactly what the deliberate-
practice literature says is necessary
to improve. This is why, early in
their careers, graduate students
experience great leaps in their
abilities.1
But at a research-oriented
program like the one offered by
MIT’s computer science
department, your course work
winds down after the first two
years. Soon after, your research
efforts are expected to release
themselves from your advisor’s
orbit and follow a self-directed
trajectory. It’s here that if you’re
not careful to keep pushing
forward, your improvement can
taper off to what the performance
scientist Anders Ericsson called an
“acceptable level,” where you then
remain stuck. The research driving
Rule #2 taught me that these
plateaus are dangerous because they
cut off your supply of career capital
and therefore cripple your ability to
keep actively shaping your working
life. As my quest continued,
therefore, it became clear that I
needed to introduce some practical
strategies into my own working life
that would force me to once again
make deliberate practice a regular
companion in my daily routine.
According to popular legend,
Richard Feynman, the Nobel Prize–
winning theoretical physicist,
scored only a slightly above-
average IQ of 125 when he was
tested in high school. In his
memoirs, however, we find hints of
how he rose from modest
intelligence to genius, when he talks
about his compulsion to tear down
important papers and mathematical
concepts until he could understand
the concepts from the bottom up.
It’s possible, in other words, that
his amazing intellect was less about
a gift from God and more about a
dedication to deliberate practice.
Motivated by my research and
examples such as Feynman, I
decided that focusing my attention
on a bottom-up understanding of
my own field’s most difficult
results would be a good first step
toward revitalizing my career capital
stores.
To initiate these efforts, I chose a
paper that was well cited in my
research niche, but that was also
considered obtuse and hard to
follow. The paper focused on only
a single result—the analysis of an
algorithm that offers the best-
known solution to a well-known
problem. Many people have cited
this result, but few have understood
the details that support it. I decided
that mastering this notorious paper
would prove a perfect introduction
to my new regime of self-enforced
deliberate practice.
Here was my first lesson: This
type of skill development is hard.
When I got to the first tricky gap in
the paper’s main proof argument, I
faced immediate internal resistance.
It was as if my mind realized the
effort I was about to ask it to
expend, and in response it
unleashed a wave of neuronal
protest, distant at first, but then as I
persisted increasingly tremendous,
crashing over my concentration
with mounting intensity.
To combat this resistance, I
deployed two types of structure.
The first type was time structure: “I
am going to work on this for one
hour,” I would tell myself. “I don’t
care if I faint from the effort, or
make no progress, for the next hour
this is my whole world.” But of
course I wouldn’t faint and
eventually I would make progress.
It took, on average, ten minutes for
the waves of resistance to die
down. Those ten minutes were
always difficult, but knowing that
my efforts had a time limit helped
ensure that the difficulty was
manageable.
The second type of structure I
deployed was information structure
—a way of capturing the results of
my hard focus in a useful form. I
started by building a proof map that
captured the dependencies between
the different pieces of the proof.
This was hard, but not too hard,
and it got me warmed up in my
efforts to understand the result. I
then advanced from the maps to
short self-administered quizzes that
forced me to memorize the key
definitions the proof used. Again,
this was a relatively easy task, but it
still took concentration, and the
result was an understanding that
was crucial for parsing the detailed
math that came next.
After these first two steps,
emboldened by my initial successes
in deploying hard focus, I moved
on to the big guns: proof
summaries. This is where I forced
myself to take each lemma and
walk through each step of its proofs
—filling in missing steps. I would
conclude by writing a detailed
summary in my own words. This
was staggeringly demanding, but
the fact that I had already spent time
on easier tasks in the paper built up
enough momentum to help push me
forward.
I returned to this paper regularly
over a period of two weeks. When I
was done, I had probably
experienced fifteen hours total of
deliberate practice–style strain, but
due to its intensity it felt like much
more. Fortunately, this effort led to
immediate benefits. Among other
things, it allowed me to understand
whole swaths of related work that
had previously been mysterious.
The researchers who wrote this
paper had enjoyed a near monopoly
on solving this style of problem—
now I could join them. Leveraging
this new understanding, I went on
to prove a new result, which I
published at a top conference in my
field. This is now a new research
direction open for me to explore as
I see fit. Perhaps even more
indicative of this strategy’s value is
that I actually ended up finding a
pair of mistakes in the paper. When
I told the authors, it turned out I
was only the second person to
notice them, and they hadn’t yet
published a correction. To help
calibrate the magnitude of this
omission, bear in mind that
according to Google Scholar the
paper had already been cited close
to sixty times.
More important than these small
successes, however, was the new
mindset this test case introduced.
Strain, I now accepted, was good.
Instead of seeing this discomfort as
a sensation to avoid, I began to
understand it the same way that a
body builder understands muscle
burn: a sign that you’re doing
something right. Inspired by this
insight, I accompanied a promise to
do more large-scale paper
deconstructions of this type with a
trio of smaller habits designed to
inject even more deliberate practice
into my daily routine. I describe
these new routines below:
My Research Bible Routine
At some point during my quest, I
started what I came to call my
research bible, which is, in reality,
a document I keep on my
computer. Here’s the routine: Once
a week I require myself to
summarize in my “bible” a paper I
think might be relevant to my
research. This summary must
include a description of the result,
how it compares to previous work,
and the main strategies used to
obtain it. These summaries are less
involved than the step-by-step
deconstruction I did on my original
test-case paper—which is what
allows me to do them on a weekly
basis—but they still induce the
strain of deliberate practice.
My Hour-Tally Routine
Another deliberate-practice routine
was the introduction of my hour
tally—a sheet of paper I mounted
behind my desk at MIT, and plan
on remounting at Georgetown. The
sheet has a row for each month on
which I keep a tally of the total
number of hours I’ve spent that
month in a state of deliberate
practice. I started the tally sheet on
March 15, 2011, and in the last two
weeks of that month I experienced
12 hours of strain. In April, the first
full month of this record keeping, I
got the tally up to 42 hours. In May,
I backslid to 26.5 hours and in June
this fell to 23 hours. (In fairness,
these last two months were a period
during which I was up to my ears in
the logistics of switching from my
position at MIT to my position at
Georgetown.) By having these hour
counts stare me in the face every
day I’m motivated to find new ways
to fit more deliberate practice into
my schedule. Without this routine,
my total amount of time spent
stretching my abilities would
undoubtedly be much lower.
My Theory-Notebook Routine
My third strategy was the purchase
of the most expensive notebook I
could find at the MIT bookstore: an
archival-quality lab notebook that
cost me forty-five dollars. This
notebook boasts a nice thick
cardboard cover, mounted on
double-wire spirals, that falls open
flat. The pages are acid-free, thick,
and gridded. I use this notebook
when brainstorming new theory
results. At the end of each of these
brainstorming sessions I require
myself to formally record the
results, by hand, on a dated page.
The expense of the notebook helps
signal the importance of what I’m
supposed to write inside it, and this,
in turn, forces me into the strain
required to collect and organize my
thinking. The result: more
deliberate practice.
The insights of Rule #2
fundamentally changed the way I
approach my work. If I had to
describe my previous way of
thinking, I would probably use the
phrase “productivity-centric.”
Getting things done was my
priority. When you adopt a
productivity mindset, however,
deliberate practice-inducing tasks
are often sidestepped, as the
ambiguous path toward their
completion, when combined with
the discomfort of the mental strain
they require, makes them an
unpopular choice in scheduling
decisions. It’s much easier to
redesign your graduate-student Web
page than it is to grapple with a
mind-melting proof. The result for
me was that my career capital
stores, initially built up during the
forced strain of my early years as a
graduate student, were dwindling as
time went on. Researching Rule #2,
however, changed this state of
affairs by making me much more
“craft-centric.” Getting better and
better at what I did became what
mattered most, and getting better
required the strain of deliberate
practice. This is a different way of
thinking about work, but once you
embrace it, the changes to your
career trajectory can be profound.
How I Applied Rule #3
In the early spring of 2011, my
academic-job hunt took an
interesting turn. At the time, I had a
verbal offer from Georgetown
University, but nothing in writing,
and as my postdoctoral advisor told
me, “If it’s not in writing, it doesn’t
count.” While waiting for the
official offer, I received an
interview invitation from a well-
known state university with a well-
funded research program. Deciding
how to navigate this career
conundrum was vastly simplified
by my quest, which was under way
at the same time. In particular, it
was my investigation of the value
of control, as detailed in Rule #3,
that provided me guidance.
Rule #3 argued that control over
what you do and how you do it is
such a powerful force for building
remarkable careers that it could
rightly be called a “dream-job
elixir.” When you study the type of
careers that make others remark,
“That’s the type of job I want,” this
trait almost always plays a central
role. Once you understand this
value of control, it changes the way
you evaluate opportunities, leading
you to consider a position’s
potential autonomy as being as
important as its offered salary or the
institution’s reputation. This was
the mindset I took into my own job
search, and it helped me reenvision
my choice between accepting
Georgetown’s offer or delaying it to
go interview at the unnamed state
university.
There were two important points
I noticed when I started evaluating
my options through the lens of
control. First, Georgetown was just
starting up its computer science
PhD program as part of a more
general campus-wide investment in
the sciences. Throughout my job-
hunt process, my PhD advisor at
MIT had been telling me about her
experiences, early in her own
career, working in Georgia Tech’s
computer science department
during the period when it, too, was
first transitioning toward a
research-centric program. “In a
growing program, you’ll always
have a say,” she told me.
By contrast, at a well-established
institution, your position in the
hierarchy as a new assistant
professor is clear: at the bottom. At
these universities, you often have to
wait until you’re a full professor,
years and years into your career,
before you can start affecting the
program’s direction. Until this point
you follow along with what gets
passed down from on high.
The second thing I noticed was
that Georgetown’s tenure process
was going to differ somewhat from
the pattern of standard well-
established programs. At a large
research institution, tenure happens
as follows: Higher-ups in the
administration send out letters to
other people in your general field
and ask whether you’re the top
person in your particular specialty.
If you’re not, they’ll fire you and
try to hire whoever is. Some places
go so far as to essentially tell their
new hires not to expect tenure.
(Academic-job markets are so
tough, and with so much more
available talent than open positions,
they can get away with this.)
If your specialty is new—as
mine is—and they can’t therefore
find experts with an opinion on it
either way, you’re going to have a
real hard time keeping your
position, as there’s no one out there
to validate your stature. Because of
this, the system rewards conformity
for junior faculty: That is, the safest
route to tenure is to take a robust
research topic that already has lots
of interest and then outwork your
peers. If you want to innovate, wait
until later in your career. In his
famed “Last Lecture,” the late
Carnegie Mellon computer science
professor Randy Pausch captured
this reality well when he quipped,
“Junior faculty members used to
come up to me and say, ‘Wow, you
got tenure early; what’s your
secret?’ I said, ‘It’s pretty simple,
call me any Friday night in my
office at ten o’clock and I’ll tell
you.’ ”
Georgetown, by contrast, made it
clear that they weren’t interested in
this explicit comparison-based
approach to tenure. At this stage in
its growth, the computer science
department was more focused on
developing star researchers than
trying to hire them away. In other
words, if I published good results
in good venues, I could stay.
Without pressure to choose a safe,
pre-existing area to dominate, I
would therefore have much more
flexibility in how my research
program unfolded.
Viewed from the perspective of
the control I would enjoy over my
career, Georgetown was clearly
more attractive than the well-
established state university. Before
finalizing my decision, however, I
took some time to reflect on the
other insights of Rule #3—insights
that nuanced its otherwise
enthusiastic endorsement of
autonomy. During my quest, for
example, I discovered two traps that
typically trip people up in their
search for control. The first trap
was having too little career capital.
If you go after more control in your
working life without a rare and
valuable skill to offer in return,
you’re likely pursuing a mirage.
This was the trap tripped, for
example, by the many fans of
lifestyle design, who left their
traditional jobs to try to make a
living on passive income-generating
websites. Many of these contrarians
quickly discovered that the income-
generating piece of that plan doesn’t
work well if you don’t have
something valuable to offer in
exchange for people’s money. This
trap might not seem relevant to my
job hunt, as the academic-search
process usually demands large
stores of career capital—in the form
of peer-reviewed publications and
strong recommendation letters—
before a candidate has a possibility
of earning an offer. But there are
departments lurking out there that
will attract second-tier candidates
(i.e., those without much career
capital) with the allure of the
autonomous academic life, but
then, once they arrive on campus,
saddle them with an overwhelming
amount of teaching and service
responsibilities. In other words,
even in this rarefied world, one
must still be wary of control
mirages.
The second trap describes what
happens when you do have enough
capital to successfully make a shift
toward more control. It’s at this
point that you’re most likely to
encounter resistance from others in
your life, as more control usually
benefits only you. Fortunately for
me, my closest advisors at MIT
encouraged me to pursue the
flexibility offered by a fast-growing
program like Georgetown’s. But
there were certainly those farther
out in my professional orbit who
were more resistant to this decision.
To them, pounding a well-trod path
at a well-established university was
the safest route to the desired
outcome of tenure and a good
research reputation. The personal
benefits of having more control
over my work were not on their
professional radar, so any decision
outside the safe decision was
deemed alarming.
While researching Rule #3, I
came across a useful tool for
navigating between these two traps.
I called it the law of financial
viability, and described it as
follows: “When deciding whether to
follow an appealing pursuit that will
introduce more control into your
work life, ask yourself whether
people are willing to pay you for it.
If so, continue. If not, move on.”
Ultimately, this was the law that
helped me finalize my own career
decision. Georgetown offered much
greater potential for control over
what I did and how I did it. This
seemed clear. Furthermore, they
were willing to pay me well for this
move toward autonomy, both
financially and in terms of support
for my research initiatives.
According to the law of financial
viability, I could therefore be
confident that in going to
Georgetown I would be avoiding
both control traps: I had enough
career capital to exchange for the
potential flexibility and could
confidently ignore the status quo–
themed voices of resistance. So I
turned down the interview request
from the state university and held
out for Georgetown.
How I Applied Rule #4
As explained in Rule #4, a career
mission is an organizing purpose to
your working life. It’s what leads
people to become famous for what
they do and ushers in the
remarkable opportunities that come
along with such fame. It’s also an
idea that has long fascinated me.
Academia is a profession well
suited for mission. If you identify
professors with particularly
compelling careers, and then ask
what they did differently than their
peers, the answer almost always
involves them organizing their
work around a catchy mission.
Consider, for example, Alan
Lightman, an MIT physics
professor turned writer. Lightman
started as a traditional physicist but
was writing on the side—both
fiction and nonfiction that grappled
with the human side of science.
He’s perhaps best known for his
bestselling, award-winning novel,
Einstein’s Dreams,2 though he’s
written many other books, and his
essays have appeared in basically
every important American literary
publication.
Lightman’s career is based on his
mission to explore the human side
of science, and this led him to
fascinating places. He left behind
the grueling MIT physics tenure
track to become the first professor
in the Institute’s history to be dual-
appointed in both science and
humanities. He helped develop
MIT’s communications requirement
and then went on to found its
graduate science-writing program.
By the time I met Lightman, he had
shifted to an adjunct-professor
position, providing him even more
freedom in his schedule, and had
crafted for himself an impressively
unburdened life of the mind. He
now teaches writing courses that he
designed and that focus on issues
he thinks are important. He has
freed himself from the need to be
constantly seeking grant money or
publications. He spends his
summers with his family on an
island in Maine—a location with no
phone, TV, or Internet—
presumably thinking big thoughts
while basking in the sublimity of
his surroundings. Most impressive
to me, Lightman’s contact page on
his official MIT website gives the
following disclaimer: “I don’t use e-
mail”—a move toward simplicity
that a less famous academic would
never get away with.
This is just one example among
many of professors who leveraged
mission to create an offbeat and
compelling career. Some of these
professors, such as Pardis Sabeti
and Kirk French, I ended up
tracking down and interviewing
when researching this book, which
is why you’ll find the details of
their stories in Rule #4. Others,
such as Alan Lightman, or Erez
Lieberman, who earned fame by the
age of thirty-one through his
combination of mathematics and
cultural studies, or Esther Duflo,
who won a MacArthur “Genius
Grant” for her work evaluating ant-
poverty programs, didn’t make the
cut for the book, but still weigh
heavily on my thinking about how
to best shape my own career.
It wasn’t until I got started in
earnest in my Rule #4 research,
however, and met mission mavens
such as Pardis, Kirk, and Giles
Bowkett, that I understood just how
tricky it is to make this trait a reality
in your working life. The more you
try to force it, I learned, the less
likely you are to succeed. True
missions, it turns out, require two
things. First you need career capital,
which requires patience. Second,
you need to be ceaselessly scanning
your always-changing view of the
adjacent possible in your field,
looking for the next big idea. This
requires a dedication to
brainstorming and exposure to new
ideas. Combined, these two
commitments describe a lifestyle,
not a series of steps that
automatically spit out a mission
when completed. As I entered the
summer of 2011, I leveraged this
new understanding to try to
transform my approach to work
into one that would lead to a
successful mission. These efforts
generated a series of routines that I
combined into a mission-
development system. This system is
best understood as a three-level
pyramid. I’ll explain each of these
levels below.
Top Level: The Tentative Research
Mission
My system is guided, at the top
level of the pyramid, by a tentative
research mission—a sort of rough
guideline for the type of work I’m
interested in doing. Right now, my
mission reads, “To apply distributed
algorithm theory to interesting new
places with the goal of producing
interesting new results.” In order to
identify this mission description, I
had first to acquire career capital in
my field. I’ve published and read
enough distributed algorithm results
to know that there’s great potential
in moving this body of theory to
new settings. The real challenge, of
course, is finding the compelling
projects that exploit this potential.
This is the goal the other two levels
of the pyramid are designed to
pursue.
Bottom Level: Background
Research
We now dive from the top level of
the pyramid to the bottom level,
where we find my dedication to
background research. Here’s my
rule: Every week, I expose myself
to something new about my field. I
can read a paper, attend a talk, or
schedule a meeting. To ensure that I
really understand the new idea, I
require myself to add a summary, in
my own words, to my growing
“research bible” (which I
introduced earlier in this conclusion
when discussing how I applied
Rule #2). I also try to carve out one
walk each day for free-form
thinking about the ideas turned up
by this background research (I
commute to work on foot and have
a dog to exercise, so I have many
such walks to choose from in my
schedule). The choice of what
material to expose myself to is
guided by my mission description at
the top of the pyramid.
This background-research
process, which combines exposure
to potentially relevant material with
free-form re-combination of ideas,
comes straight out of Steven
Johnson’s book, Where Good Ideas
Come From, which I introduced in
Rule #4 when talking about his
notion of the adjacent possible.
According to Johnson, access to
new ideas and to the “liquid
networks” that facilitate their
mixing and matching often provides
the catalyst for breakthrough new
ideas.
Middle Level: Exploratory Projects
We arrive now at the middle level
of the pyramid, which is
responsible for most of the work I
produce as a professor. As
explained in Rule #4, an effective
strategy for making the leap from a
tentative mission idea to compelling
accomplishments is to use small
projects that I called “little bets”
(borrowing the phrase from Peter
Sims’s 2010 book of the same title).
As you might recall, a little bet, in
the setting of mission exploration,
has the following characteristics:
It’s a project small enough to
be completed in less than a
month.
It forces you to create new
value (e.g., master a new skill
and produce new results that
didn’t exist before).
It produces a concrete result
that you can use to gather
concrete feedback.
I use little bets to explore the
most promising ideas turned up by
the processes described by the
bottom level of my pyramid. I try to
keep only two or three bets active at
a time so that they can receive
intense attention. I also use
deadlines, which I highlight in
yellow in my planning documents,
to help keep the urgency of their
completion high. Finally, I also
track my hours spent on these bets
in the hour tally I described back in
the section of this conclusion
dedicated to my application of Rule
#2. I found that without these
accountability tools, I tended to
procrastinate on this work, turning
my attention to more urgent but less
important matters.
When a little bet finishes, I use
the concrete feedback it generates to
guide my research efforts going
forward. This feedback tells me, for
example, whether a given project
should be aborted and, if not, what
direction is most promising to
explore next. The effort of
completing these bets also has the
added side benefit of inducing
deliberate practice—yet another
tactic in my ever-growing playbook
dedicated to making me better and
better at what I do.
Ultimately, the success or failure
of the projects pursued in this
middle level helps me evolve the
research mission maintained by the
top level. In other words, the
system as a whole is a closed
feedback loop—constantly evolving
toward a clearer and better
supported vision for my work.
Final Thoughts: Working Right
Trumps Finding the Right Work
This book opened with the story of
Thomas, who believed that the key
to happiness is to follow your
passion. True to this conviction, he
followed his passion for Zen
practice to a remote monastery in
the Catskill Mountains. Once there,
he applied himself to the study of
Zen, immersing himself in
meditation and pondering endless
Dharma lectures.
But Thomas didn’t find the
happiness he expected. He realized
instead that although his
surroundings had changed, he was
“exactly the same person” as before
he arrived at the monastery. The
thought patterns that had previously
convinced him, job after job, that
he hadn’t yet found his true calling
had not disappeared. When we left
Thomas back in this book’s
introduction, the weight of this
realization had reduced him to tears.
He sat in the quiet oak forest
surrounding the monastery, crying.
Almost ten years later, I met
Thomas at a coffee shop not far
from my building at MIT. He was
working in Germany at the time and
was visiting Boston for a
conference. Thomas is tall and slim
with close-cropped hair. He wears
the thin-framed square glasses that
seem to be mandatory issue among
European knowledge workers. As
we sat and sipped coffee, Thomas
filled me in on his life after his Zen
crisis.
Here’s what I learned: After
leaving the monastery, Thomas
returned to the banking job he had
left two years earlier when he
moved to the Catskills to pursue his
passion. This time, however, he
approached his working life with a
new awareness. His experience at
the monastery had freed him from
the escapist thoughts of fantasy jobs
that had once dominated his mind.
He was able instead to focus on the
tasks he was given and on
accomplishing them well. He was
free from the constant, draining
comparisons he used to make
between his current work and some
magical future occupation waiting
to be discovered.
This new focus, and the output it
produced, was appreciated by
management. Nine months into his
job he was promoted. Then he was
promoted again. And then again!
Within two years he had moved
from a lowly data-entry position to
being put in charge of a computer
system that managed over $6 billion
of investment assets. By the time I
met him, he had been put in charge
of a system that manages five times
that amount. His work is
challenging, but Thomas enjoys the
challenge. It also provides him with
a sense of respect, impact, and
autonomy—exactly the kind of rare
and valuable traits, as you might
recall, that I argued back in Rule #2
are needed for creating work you
love. Thomas acquired these traits
not by matching his work to his
passion, but instead by doing his
work well and then strategically
cashing in the capital it generated.
Managing computer systems
might not generate the daily bliss
that defined Thomas’s old
daydreams, but as he now
recognized, nothing would. A
fulfilling working life is a more
subtle experience than his old
fantasies had allowed. As we
chatted, Thomas agreed that a good
way of describing his
transformation is that he came to
realize a simple truth: Working
right trumps finding the right
work. He didn’t need to have a
perfect job to find occupational
happiness—he needed instead a
better approach to the work already
available to him.
I think it’s fitting to end on
Thomas’s story, as it sums up the
message at the core of this book:
Working right trumps finding the
right work—it’s a simple idea, but
it’s also incredibly subversive, as it
overturns decades of folk career
advice all focused on the mystical
value of passion. It wrenches us
away from our daydreams of an
overnight transformation into
instant job bliss and provides
instead a more sober way toward
fulfillment. This is why I left this
conclusion to Thomas’s saga until
the end of the book. I wanted the
chance to first explore with you,
through the four rules that came
before, the nuances of “working
right,” providing example after
example of how this approach can
lead to increased enjoyment of your
own working life. Now that you’re
armed with these insights, it’s my
hope that the end to Thomas’s story
is no longer so surprising.
I love what I do for a living. I’m
also confident that as I continue my
commitment to the ideas discovered
in my quest, this love will only
deepen. Thomas feels the same way
about his work. So do most of the
people I profiled in the book.
I want you to share in this
confidence. To accomplish this
goal, let the rules I uncovered guide
you. Don’t obsess over discovering
your true calling. Instead, master
rare and valuable skills. Once you
build up the career capital that these
skills generate, invest it wisely. Use
it to acquire control over what you
do and how you do it, and to
identify and act on a life-changing
mission. This philosophy is less
sexy than the fantasy of dropping
everything to go live among the
monks in the mountains, but it’s
also a philosophy that has been
shown time and again to actually
work.
So next time you start to
question whether you’re missing
out on some dream job waiting for
you to muster the courage to pursue
it, conjure up a pair of images.
First, recall passion-obsessed
Thomas, heartbroken and sobbing
on the forest floor. Then replace
this with the image of the smiling,
confident, value-focused man who
ten years later joined me for coffee
—the version of Thomas who
looked at me at one point in our
conversation and remarked, without
irony, “Life is good.”
Career Profile Summaries
A quick summary of the main
career profiles from the book,
presented in the order in which
they appear.
JOE DUFFY
(introduced in Rule #2)
Current job:
Before recently retiring, Joe ran
Duffy & Partners, his own fifteen-
person branding and design shop.
Why he loves what he does:
He worked on handpicked
international projects and was
greatly respected (and rewarded)
for his work. Between engagements
he spent much of his time at Duffy
Trails, a hundred-acre retreat he
owns, tucked away on the banks of
Wisconsin’s Totagatic River.
How he applied the rules
described in this book to get this
job:
When Joe was starting out in his
advertising career, like many at his
young age, he chafed at the
constraints of working for a large
company. He had originally planned
on being an artist and was
entertaining the thought of quitting
his job and returning to that
“dream.” Instead, Joe deployed
career capital theory. He realized
that the traits that define great work
are rare and valuable and that
therefore they require rare and
valuable skills to be offered in
return. He found a specialty within
his field—brand communication
through logos—and hunkered
down to dominate the skill. He was
hired away by a larger agency,
which gave him more money and
more freedom. As he continued to
build career capital, they appeased
him by allowing him to run an
independent agency within the
larger agency—providing Joe even
more control. Eventually, he left to
run his own shop on his own terms,
using the monetary rewards of his
expertise to buy Duffy Trails. Given
that before he retired he controlled
when he worked and what he
worked on, he was able to get the
most out of both his work and his
relaxation.
ALEX BERGER
(introduced in Rule #2)
Current job:
Alex is a successful television
writer.
Why he loves what he does:
When you’re good enough to find a
steady stream of work, television
writing is a fantastic gig. It pays you
loads of money to do highly
creative projects that are seen by
millions. In addition, it also gives
you months off every year.
How he applied the rules
described in this book to get this
job:
When Alex first arrived in
Hollywood, Ivy League diploma in
hand, he thought he could break
into the industry by launching and
carefully managing a variety of
different entertainment-related
projects. It turned out that no one
cared about his big ideas. It didn’t
take long for Alex to pare his
attention down to a more specific
pursuit: television writing. He
realized that all that mattered in this
field was a single type of career
capital: the ability to write quality
scripts.
Using the practice techniques
honed as a college debate
champion, he began to
systematically improve his
scriptwriting capability, sometimes
working on as many as four or five
writing projects at a time, while
constantly exposing himself to
ruthless feedback. This strategy
paid off as his scriptwriting
improved quickly, eventually
earning him his first produced
scripts, which in turn earned him
his first staff writing jobs, which
led to him cocreating a show with
Michael Eisner. This is a classic
example of career capital theory in
action. To get a job he loved, Alex
needed to first become so good that
he couldn’t be ignored.
MIKE JACKSON
(introduced in Rule #2)
Current job:
Mike is a director at the Westly
Group, a cleantech venture capital
firm on Silicon Valley’s famous
Sand Hill Road.
Why he loves what he does:
Clean-energy venture capital is a
hot field. It offers a way to help the
world while at the same time, as
Mike admitted, “You make a lot of
money.”
How he applied the rules
described in this book to get this
job:
Mike didn’t start with a clear vision
of what he wanted to do with his
life. He did understand, however,
the basics of career capital theory:
The more rare and valuable skills
you have to offer, the more
interesting opportunities will
become available. With this in
mind, Mike formed his early career
around the goal of dominating one
valuable pursuit after another,
trusting that the large stores of
career capital this would generate
would lead him somewhere worth
going. He started by choosing an
ambitious master’s thesis project
that ended up making him an expert
on international carbon markets. He
then leveraged this expertise to run
a green-energy start-up that sold
carbon offsets contracts to
American companies.
This combination of expert
knowledge on green-energy
markets and entrepreneurship
experience made him a perfect
match for the Westly Group, the
clean-energy venture capital firm
where he now works. Throughout
this process, Mike’s focus was on
how to get better, not on figuring
out his true calling. The result was
an enviable job.
RYAN VOILAND
(introduced in Rule #3)
Current job:
Ryan, along with his wife, Sarah,
runs Red Fire Farm, a thriving
organic farm in Granby,
Massachusetts.
Why he loves what he does:
Ryan has been training in
horticulture since he was a teenager.
To now own land that he can
cultivate on his own terms is deeply
fulfilling to him.
How he applied the rules
described in this book to get this
job:
Many people harbor a rosy image
of farm life. They imagine it would
be nice to spend time outdoors in
nice weather and be free from the
distractions of the modern office.
Spend time with Ryan at Red Fire,
however, and this myth is quickly
dispelled. Farming, it turns out, is
hard work. The weather is not
something you enjoy, as if on
vacation, but instead a force poised
to play havoc with your crops. And
far from being free from modern
distractions, a farmer is a
businessman, with all the e-mail,
Excel spreadsheets, and
QuickBooks software that come
along with that role. The reason
Ryan loves what he does, it turns
out, is not that he gets to be outside
or be free from e-mail, but instead
that he has control—over both
what he does and how he does it.
This trait, as described in Rule
#3, is crucial for creating work you
love. What’s important about
Ryan’s story is that he didn’t just
decide one day that farming would
provide nice control and then go
buy some land. Instead, he
recognized that control, like any
valuable career trait, requires career
capital to acquire. With this in
mind, he built up his farming skills
for over a decade before setting out
on his own. It started with
cultivating his parents’ garden and
selling produce by the road. From
there, he slowly built up his abilities
by taking on larger cultivation
projects. By the time he left for
Cornell to study horticulture, he
was renting land from a local
farmer. It wasn’t until after he
earned his degree that he applied
for a loan for his first parcel of
land. Given his expertise, it’s not
surprising that his new farm
thrived. He’s a perfect example of
both the value of control and the
patient capital acquisition required
before you can gain this trait in
your working life.
LULU YOUNG
(introduced in Rule #3)
Current job:
Lulu is a freelance software
developer.
Why she loves what she does:
Lulu enjoys challenging software
projects, but she also enjoys having
control over her life, including
when she works, what she works
on, and under what terms. As a
freelance developer with skills that
are in high demand, she has been
able to maintain that control,
allowing her to mix her work with a
variety of different leisurely
pursuits, from monthlong trips to
Asia, to pilot’s training, to weekday
afternoons spent with her nephew.
How she applied the rules
described in this book to get this
job:
Lulu, like Ryan, is a good example
of the value of control. Also like
Ryan, she’s a good example of
leveraging career capital in pursuit
of this trait. Lulu didn’t decide out
of the blue to be a freelance
developer; instead she built up her
skills and reputation over many
years in the industry. She now has
more than enough career capital to
set her own terms for her work.
When you study her story,
however, you learn that this shift
toward increased autonomy didn’t
happen all at once. Instead, Lulu
developed a steady stream of bids
for increased freedom as she got
increasingly good at what she did.
It started with her first job as a
software tester—the bottom of the
developer heap. Lulu figured out
how to automate much of the
testing process. The capital this
generated allowed her to then
bargain for a thirty-hour workweek
so she could take philosophy
classes on the side. As she got even
better at what she did, she invested
her growing capital stores in
obtaining positions at a series of
start-ups, where she was given
more and more control over her
work. It was after one of these
start-ups was acquired by a large
company, which promptly added
new constraints, that Lulu
transitioned to a freelance role. At
this point, however, her career
capital stores were more than
sufficient to support this final bid
for even more control.
DEREK SIVERS
(introduced in Rule #3)
Current job:
Derek is an entrepreneur, writer,
and thinker.
Why he loves what he does:
Derek has had enough successes in
his career that he can now live
where he wants and work on
projects he finds interesting when
he decides he’s in the mood to
work. He’s in complete control over
his life and is taking full advantage
of this autonomy.
How he applied the rules
described in this book to get this
job:
Derek is another example of control
being a defining trait of a great
career. What made him most
relevant to our discussion in Rule
#3, however, is the rule he deploys
when deciding whether or not to
pursue a bid for more autonomy. I
called this rule “the law of financial
viability,” and it says that you
should only pursue a project if
people are willing to pay you for it.
If they aren’t, you probably don’t
have sufficient capital to exchange
for the control you desire.
This is the law that helped guide
Derek to his current levels of
success. He first applied it when
deciding to quit his job at Warner
Bros. to become a full-time
musician. He delayed this decision
until the money he was making
from music was equal to what he
made in his day job—if he couldn’t
get to this modest level of income
with part-time playing, he reasoned,
then he was unlikely to enjoy
enough success pursuing this career
full-time. He next applied the law
when starting CD Baby, the
company he eventually sold for
millions. He didn’t drop everything
to pursue his entrepreneurial
ambition. Instead, he started small.
When the company made a little
money, he used this money to
expand it so it could make a little
more. When it started to make a lot
of money, only then did he decide
to make it into his full-time job.
The courage culture pushes us to
make drastic bids for increased
control over our working lives.
Derek’s example provides a nice
reality check. Seeking freedom is
good, but it’s easy to fail in this
pursuit. The law of financial
viability provides a good guide past
these pitfalls.
PARDIS SABETI
(introduced in Rule #4)
Current job:
Pardis is a professor of
evolutionary biology at Harvard
University.
Why she loves what she does:
Pardis’s academic career is built
around a mission that she finds
both exciting and important: to use
computational genetics to help rid
the world of ancient diseases.
How she applied the rules
described in this book to get this
job:
Pardis is a good example of the
value of organizing your working
life around a compelling mission.
Many professors are overwhelmed
by their jobs and eventually
descend into a state of bitter
cynicism. Pardis avoided this fate
by dedicating her work toward
something she finds important and
exciting. Of equal importance is
how she found her mission. Many
people incorrectly believe that
coming up with a mission is the
easy part (it’s something that just
happens in a moment of
inspiration) and that what’s hard is
mustering the courage to pursue it.
Rule #4 argued the opposite. It said
that real missions—those that you
can build a career around—require
that you build up extensive amounts
of expertise before they can be
identified.
Once they are identified,
however, pursuing them is often a
no-brainer. This is exactly what we
find in the story of Pardis. It took
years of skill acquisition before
Pardis was able to identify the
mission that now defines her career.
After college she went on to earn
her PhD in genetics. Not quite sure
what she wanted to do with her life,
she also went to medical school. It
wasn’t until after finishing medical
school and spending time as a
postdoctoral fellow that she finally
had enough expertise in her field to
sift out this exciting new
opportunity. Overall, Pardis’s most
important commitment was to
patience. She didn’t try to force a
direction for her working life, but
instead built up her career capital
and kept her eyes open for the
interesting directions she knew this
process would uncover.
KIRK FRENCH
(introduced in Rule #4)
Current job:
Kirk teaches archaeology at Penn
State University and is the cohost of
a television show on the Discovery
Channel that lets him travel the
country helping people figure out
the historical importance of their
keepsakes and heirlooms.
Why he loves what he does:
As a teacher, Kirk has long been
interested in spreading the word
about modern archaeology. Ever
since being interviewed for a
documentary on the Mayan culture
(Kirk’s specialty), he has also been
interested in media as a vehicle for
popularizing archaeology. Landing
a television show has been a
fantastic realization of these
interests.
How he applied the rules
described in this book to get this
job:
Kirk organized his archaeological
career around the mission of
popularizing his field. This mission
has helped him turn an academic
career that could become dry or
overwhelming into a source of
adventure and fulfillment. As with
Pardis, this mission first required
career capital—in Kirk’s case, this
came in the form of his PhD. His
story, however, also highlights the
first of two strategies presented in
Rule #4 for helping career missions,
once they’re identified, succeed.
The idea to host a television
show did not come to Kirk out of
the blue. Instead, he explored his
general mission idea—to popularize
archaeology—by means of a series
of “little bets.” Many of these, such
as his attempts to raise finances for
a documentary, failed, but these
failures were important, as they
helped Kirk shift his attention away
from non-productive directions. In
the end, it was one of these bets that
led him directly to his television
show. He decided to film a visit to a
local man who claimed to have
found the Knights Templars’
treasure buried in his suburban
Pittsburgh property.
Not long afterward, a producer
wrote Kirk’s department chair
looking for ideas for an
archaeology-related television
show. Kirk saw the e-mail and sent
the producer his Knights Templar
tape. The producer loved it, and not
long after, a show concept was
born with Kirk as the host. Building
the expertise to identify a quality
career mission is the first step
toward leveraging this trait. As
Kirk’s story demonstrated,
deploying a series of little bets to
feel out the best way forward with
this mission is a good second step.
GILES BOWKETT
(introduced in Rule #4)
Current job:
Giles is a well-known Ruby
software programmer. His renown
has allowed him to shift between
many jobs, following his interest of
the moment. He’s worked for the
country’s top Ruby shop, supported
himself entirely off of blog income,
helped a Hollywood movie star
launch a Web-based entertainment
venture, and, most recently, started
writing a book.
Why he loves what he does:
Because Giles has a hyperkinetic
personality, his ability to jump from
one interesting job to another,
moving on once something
becomes boring, is a perfect match
for his rapidly shifting attention.
Spend any time around Giles and
you’ll realize how miserable he
would be if forced by economic
necessity into a long-term,
traditional, forty-hour-a-week job.
How he applied the rules
described in this book to get this
job:
Giles is another example of mission
being used as the foundation for a
great career. In this case, the
mission is combining the worlds of
the arts and Ruby programming.
Giles made this mission a success
when he released Archaeopteryx, an
open-source software program that
writes and performs its own music.
This software gave Giles the fame
within his community that has
supported his kinetic career
trajectory ever since.
Like Pardis and Kirk, Giles
needed career capital before he
could identify his mission. He
seriously studied and performed
music and spent many years
developing his programming skills
before he was at a sufficient level
of expertise to recognize the
potential in combining these
worlds. His story, however, also
captures the second of the two
strategies presented in Rule #4 for
helping missions, once identified, to
succeed. This second strategy,
which I called “the law of
remarkability,” says that a good
mission-driven project should be
remarkable in two ways: First, it
should compel people to remark
about it, and second, it should be
deployed in a venue conducive to
remarking. These were the rules
that led Giles to his idea for
Archaeopteryx. He recognized that a
demo of a piece of computer code
generating sophisticated music
would be something that would
catch people’s attention. He had
also realized that the open-source
software community was well
structured to spread the word about
interesting projects, making it a
perfect venue for the software’s
release. Combined, these two traits
made the project, and therefore
Giles’s career mission, a success.
Acknowledgments
The decision to write this book can
be traced back to a series of posts
on the passion hypothesis that I first
published on my blog, Study
Hacks. The reaction from my
readers was immediate and
voluminous. Their feedback helped
shape and focus my thinking on
this topic and convinced me that
this was a discussion worth sharing
with a wider audience. As such, I
thank them for spurring me into
starting this project.
It was at this point that my
publishing team entered the picture.
My longtime agent and mentor,
Laurie Abkemeier, worked her
magic and helped me transform my
diverse thoughts into a cohesive
book proposal. The book ended up
with Rick Wolff at Grand
Central/Business Plus, and I
couldn’t be happier about this turn
of events. Rick is the type of editor
authors hope for. He understood
my idea at a gut level, and his
enthusiasm for it never waned. He
helped me find the right voice for
expressing these provocative
arguments in a way that people
would accept. The book is
indisputably better due to his
efforts.
Finally, my wife, Julie, was
indispensable in the writing
process. She not only read drafts of
my work in progress but also
listened through endless iterations
of my thinking, always offering
honest and clear feedback. She was
joined in these efforts by my friend
Ben Casnocha, who conceived,
sold, and wrote a career-advice
book concurrently with my own,
allowing us to share numerous
useful conversations at all stages of
the process.

Glossary
A summary of the important terms,
theories, and laws introduced in
the book, presented in the order of
their appearance.
the passion hypothesis (introduced
in Rule #1):  This hypothesis
claims that the key to
occupational happiness is to first
figure out what you’re passionate
about and then find a job that
matches this passion. The basic
tenet behind this book is that the
passion hypothesis, although
widely believed, is both wrong
and potentially dangerous.
“Be so good they can’t ignore
you.” (introduced in Rule #2): 
A quote from comedian Steve
Martin that captures what is
needed to build a working life
you love. It is excerpted from the
following longer quote, which
Martin gave in a 2007 interview
with Charlie Rose when asked
what his advice was for aspiring
entertainers: “Nobody ever takes
note of [my advice], because it’s
not the answer they wanted to
hear. What they want to hear is
‘Here’s how you get an agent,
here’s how you write a script,’…
but I always say, ‘Be so good
they can’t ignore you.’ ”
the craftsman mindset
(introduced in Rule #2):  An
approach to your working life in
which you focus on the value of
what you are offering to the
world.
the passion mindset (introduced in
Rule #2):  An approach to your
working life in which you focus
on the value your job is offering
you. This mindset stands in
contrast to the craftsman
mindset. The passion mindset
ultimately leads to chronic
dissatisfaction and daydreaming
about the better jobs you imagine
existing out there waiting to be
discovered.
career capital (introduced in Rule
#2):  A description of the skills
you have that are rare and
valuable to the working world.
This is the key currency for
creating work you love.
the career capital theory of great
work (introduced in Rule #2): 
This theory provides the
foundation for all of the ideas
that follow it in this book. It
claims that the key to work you
love is not to follow your
passion, but instead to get good
at something rare and valuable,
and then cash in the “career
capital” this generates to acquire
the traits that define great jobs.
This requires that you approach
work with a craftsman mindset
(focusing on your value to the
world) and not a passion
mindset (focusing on what value
the world is offering you). Here
is the formal three-part definition
of the theory as presented in
Rule #2:
The traits that define great
work are rare and valuable.
Supply and demand says that if
you want these traits, you need
rare and valuable skills to offer
in return. Think of these rare
and valuable skills you can
offer as your career capital.
The craftsman mindset, with its
relentless focus on being “so
good they can’t ignore you,” is
a strategy well suited for
acquiring career capital. This is
why it trumps the passion
mindset if your goal is to have
work you love.
the 10,000-hour rule (introduced
in Rule #2):  A rule, well-known
to performance scientists,
describing the amount of practice
time required to master a skill.
Malcolm Gladwell, who
popularized the concept in his
2008 book Outliers, described it
as follows: “The idea that
excellence at performing a
complex task requires a critical
minimum level of practice
surfaces again and again in
studies of expertise. In fact,
researchers have settled on what
they believe is the magic number
for true expertise: ten thousand
hours.”
deliberate practice (introduced in
Rule #2):  The style of difficult
practice required to continue to
improve at a task. Florida State
University professor Anders
Ericsson, who coined the term in
the early 1990s, describes it
formally as an “activity designed,
typically by a teacher, for the
sole purpose of effectively
improving specific aspects of an
individual’s performance.”
Deliberate practice requires you
to stretch past where you are
comfortable and then receive
ruthless feedback on your
performance. In the context of
career construction, most
knowledge workers avoid this
style of skill development
because, quite frankly, it’s
uncomfortable. To build up large
stores of career capital, however,
which is necessary for creating
work you love, you must make
this style of practice a regular
part of your work routine.
career capital markets
(introduced in Rule #2):  When
acquiring career capital in a field,
you can envision that you’re
acquiring this capital in a specific
type of career capital market.
There are two types of these
markets: winner-take-all and
auction.
In a winner-take-all market,
there is only one type of career
capital available and lots of
different people competing for it.
An auction market, by contrast,
is less structured: There are
many different types of career
capital, and each person might
generate their own unique
collection of this capital.
Different markets require
different career capital
acquisition strategies. In a
winner-take-all market, for
example, you need to first “crack
the code” on how people master
the one skill that matters. In an
auction market, by contrast, you
might simply emphasize rareness
in the skill combinations that you
create.
control (introduced in Rule #3): 
Control is having a say in what
you do and how you do it. This
is one of the most important
traits to acquire with your career
capital when creating work you
love.
the first control trap (introduced
in Rule #3):  A warning to heed
when trying to introduce more
control into your working life. It
represents the principle that
control that’s acquired without
career capital is not sustainable.
the second control trap
(introduced in Rule #3): 
Another warning to heed when
trying to introduce more control
into your working life. It
represents the principle that
when you acquire enough career
capital to acquire meaningful
control over your working life,
that’s exactly when you’ve
become valuable enough to your
current employer that they will
try to prevent you from making
the change.
courage culture (briefly
introduced in Rule #2; elaborated
in Rule #3):  A term that
describes the growing number of
authors and online commentators
who promote the idea that the
only thing standing between you
and a dream job is building the
courage to step off the expected
path.
Though well-intentioned, this
culture is dangerous, as it
underplays the importance of
also having career capital to back
up your career aspirations. It has
led many people to quit their
current job and to end up in a
new situation where they are
much worse off than before.
the law of financial viability
(introduced in Rule #3):  A
simple law that can be deployed
to help sidestep the two control
traps when trying to introduce
more control into your working
life. It suggests that when
deciding whether to follow an
appealing pursuit that will
introduce more control into your
work life, you should ask
yourself whether people are
willing to pay for it. If so,
continue. If not, move on.
mission (introduced in Rule #4):  A
mission is another important trait
to acquire with your career
capital when creating work you
love. It provides a unifying goal
for your career. It’s more general
than a specific job and can span
multiple positions. It provides an
answer to the question “What
should I do with my life?”
the adjacent possible (introduced
in Rule #4):  A term taken from
the science writer Steven
Johnson, who took it from Stuart
Kauffman, that helps explain the
origin of innovation. Johnson
notes that the next big ideas in
any field are typically found right
beyond the current cutting edge,
in the adjacent space that
contains the possible new
combinations of existing ideas.
The key observation is that you
have to get to the cutting edge of
a field before its adjacent
possible—and the innovations it
contains—becomes visible. In
the context of career
construction, it’s important to
note that good career missions
are also often found in the
adjacent possible. The
implication, therefore, is that if
you want to find a mission in
your career, you first need to get
to the cutting edge of your field.
little bets (introduced in Rule #4): 
An idea borrowed from the
business writer Peter Sims.
When Sims studied innovative
corporations and people, he
noted the following: “Rather than
believing they have to start with
a big idea or plan out a whole
project in advance, they make a
methodical series of little bets
about what might be a good
direction, learning critical
information from lots of little
failures and from small but
significant wins” [emphasis
mine]. In the context of career
construction, little bets provide a
good strategy for exploring
productive ways to turn a vague
mission idea into specific
successful projects.
the law of remarkability
(introduced in Rule #4):  A
simple law that can help you
identify successful projects for
making your mission a reality.
(This can be used in conjunction
with the little-bets strategy.) The
law says that for a mission-
driven project to succeed, it
should be “remarkable” in two
different ways. First, it must
compel people who encounter it
to remark about it to others.
Second, it must be launched in a
venue that supports such
remarking.

1. Kirk and Jason hated this
name, as it goes against the
tenets of archaeology to assign
financial value to artifacts.
They much preferred their
original suggestion of Artifact
or Fiction. In an ironic twist,
after airing just three episodes
of the first season, the
Discovery Channel was sued
by an individual who claimed
to own the rights to American
Treasure. They pulled the
series from the air that summer
and planned to re-air it the
following summer, this time
using Kirk and Jason’s original
title suggestion.

Conclusion
1. The necessity and difficulty of
these problem sets in learning
mathematics is one of the
reservations I have about the
growing self-education
movement. Without someone
to grade your problem-set
results—a grade that might
play a big role in what options
are available to you in the
future—it’s hard to imagine
repeatedly pushing yourself
through the dozens of hours of
strain required to get yourself
to answers, and in turn
experience substantial skill
growth.
